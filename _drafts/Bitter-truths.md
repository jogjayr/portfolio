[Cracked.com](http://cracked.com) is like crack to me. I actually hate that comparison ever since BJ Novak's character in _The Office_ said something like "No one who has never tried crack should ever say that".

But whatever. After dozens of lists of weird animals, bizarre historical figures and absurd laws, I came across this: [6 Harsh Truths That Will Make You a Better Person](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/).

The short version of the article is this: if you want respect from society, you need to get the eff off your butt and get good at stuff that people find useful. The world does not care if you are "nice" or a "good person". It cares about what you can offer it. It will be a lot harder than you think. The people you hang out with (friends, family) might try and drag you down because it exposes to them their own inability or unwillingness to do the same. It's an unforgiving view of the world, and incorporates Alec Baldwin's rant from _Glengarry Glen Ross_, a movie that I instantly added to my Netflix queue. I believe it is Cracked.com's most popular article of all time.

Why do I care about this article? It's startlingly serious, lucid and useful advice from a site often known for juvenile humor and satire, for one thing. I feel like I have my s*** together right now, but I could always do better. We all could.

What you do in your spare time is the thing that you really want to do. I have a friend who is a software engineer by day. His spare time is spent playing music. He's learned several instruments and forms of dance already. 

Multiple talents and interests are common among high achievers. Elon Musk has had successful companies in 3 wildly different industries: e-commerce, space exploration and electric cars. Nathan Myrvhold is regarded as a modern-day Renaissance man: technologist, businessman, patent-troll and highly regarded chef. What's-his-face from Rolling Stone (I think) has a Ph.D. in astrophysics or some such (I'll find out the name and specialty later). Arnold Schwarzenegger was a successful businessman, a millionaire, before he ever got into the movie business. So was Sunil Shetty.

The focus on achievements might sound materialistic, but it's probably is not. Achievements don't need to be money-related. They are only judged by utility to other people. 

Does having useful skills make you a _better_ person? That probably depends on your definition of "better". When someone is described as a "good person" we think: honest, generous, loyal, kind. How does getting good at stuff make you those things? The high-achieving asshole is a common trope based on many, many real-world examples.

But why should practicing your guitar to become a rock god make you an insufferable penis? People treating you like a real god because of your rock skills...that could go to your head. Equally there are plenty of highly-skilled athletes, musicians, writers, actors, engineers and businesspeople who are perfectly decent human beings. Dickish slackers are similarly numerous.
