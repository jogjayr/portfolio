I'll say off the bat that co-working spaces and hacker spaces are great because:

1. You can be motivated by working alongside other creative people
2. They're open really late
3. Many of them focus on certain types of hacking. They're basically like clubhouses for tinkerers

But then there's the downsides:

1. Noise can be an issue, although this can vary from space to space
2. The locations can be sometimes be inconvenient
3. They're not cheap, unless the work you do there makes you money. The nearest hacker space to me is [Hacker Dojo](http://hackerdojo.com); their membership is $100/month. You can go work there for free but you will be kicked out at 10 PM and they do guilt you into making a $10 donation (not saying it's wrong, but it ain't cheap either)

I think an alternative is necessary. The [Mountain View public library](http://www.mountainview.gov/depts/library/default.asp) meets many of my needs:

1. Free, with fast Wi-fi
2. Quiet spaces where you can work undisturbed
3. Lots of books, magazines and newspapers to browse when you need a break. I think this is better than opening up Twitter and getting sucked down productivity-destroying black hole
4. Conveniently located in downtown MV

I think it would be fantastic if libraries also considered having "hacker spaces" of their own.
