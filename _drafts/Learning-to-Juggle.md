Since last month, I've been learning how to juggle.

I work at [BitTorrent](http://bittorrent.com), where it appears there's a bit of a juggling culture (actually, I don't know if that's true, but everyone here seems to juggle). I think it starts from the top; I've seen Bram Cohen juggle 5 balls.

I always thought I lacked the co-ordination to learn to juggle, but it turns out I'd been doing it wrong. I checked out [this Youtube video](link) where the guy explains that the simplest method to learn is the 3-ball cascade. Most beginners try to do a juggle where they pass the ball underhand; this is actually really hard.

The cascade style is easy to pick up, once you've developed the muscle memory. Just do what the guy in the video says and you'll be juggling within 3 to 4 weeks.
