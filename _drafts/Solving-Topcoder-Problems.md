title: Solving Topcoder Problems
teaser:

Steve Yegge convinced me that being a programmer is a bit like being a pro-athlete (except that there's less money and sex appeal involved). Even when you're not working, you need to practice and improve to stay in shape and stay relevant. To this end, I've been working on problems from [Topcoder.com](http://topcoder.com) from time to time over the past couple of months.

The first time I looked at the list of problems, I was intimidated. The problems marked "Easy" take me hours and hours to solve. I typically copy the problem statements out, write unit tests testing the cases given and then start coding. This is a great way to think of "test-first" coding (or to use the proper name, TDD). 

Topcoder's practice software, unfortunately, only supports Java and C++, both languages that I don't have much interest in coding in. So I won't be able to pick up TC points for my work. On the other hand, my code is on [Github](http://github.com/jogjayr/topcoder), which I guess is another way of getting bragging rights. Whatever.
