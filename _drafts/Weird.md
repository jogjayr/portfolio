I was out playing football (glorified jogging with a football) at the park near my place. After I was done, a kid (probably a teenager) who had been riding a bike and sitting on the swings nearby came over and asked me if I could record him doing some tricks on his bike. 

"Because I'm looking for sponsorship something something."

The kid hands me his phone (iPhone 6, I believe). I notice he doesn't have the stunt kinda bike either; looks like a road or commuter bike. It takes about 10 seconds to establish that it's too dark to video shit (I shoot an 11 second video and show him). 

I give him his phone back and leave, wondering what the heck that was about.
