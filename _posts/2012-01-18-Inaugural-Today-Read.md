###Julian Assange on Rolling Stone magazine
[Julian Assange](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/julian-assange-the-rolling-stone-interview-20120118 "Assange on Rolling Stone"), 
founder of Wikileaks, international hacker and possesor of the coolest white hair around, spoke to Rolling Stones magazine. 
Some of what he says is sensible: 
"people determined to be in a democracy, to be their own governments, must have the power that knowledge will bring". 
Some of it is exactly the kind of thing that a rumoured egomaniac would say: "I don't think I have a massive ego". Great interview.
