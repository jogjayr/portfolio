###Fallout from the Megaupload takedown

At Ars Technica, [Nate Anderson](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/why-the-feds-smashed-megaupload.ars "Why the feds smashed Megaupload"), does a great piece on analyzing the specific timing of the Megaupload crackdown, with his sources implying that it wasn't a coincidence that it happened a day after Congress' SOPA/PIPA debacle. [Kim Dotcom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Schmitz "Kim Dotcom") is a great name, it has to be said.

Over at CNET [Molly Wood](http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-57362437-256/anonymous-goes-nuclear-everybody-loses/ "Anonymous Megaupload") criticized Anonymous' actions in DDoS-ing the Justice Department, MPAA, RIAA, Boy Scouts of America and half a dozen nuns at a mission in Costa Rica. IMHO, no one except Justice Department, MPAA and RIAA employees, and reporters doing research, ever accesses those websites. Despite a scary looking screenshot from [Akamai's Internet monitor](http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/dataviz1.html, "Akamai Internet Monitor"), it's evident that the US has actually had fewer attacks in the last 24 hours (not sure how Akamai defines an "attack") than parts of the world that have had nothing to do with these events, to wit Brazil, Peru, China, Russia and Taiwan.

###Apple's Foray into Textbooks

[Megan Garber](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/a-brief-history-of-textbooks-or-why-apples-new-textbook-experience-is-actually-revolutionary/251662/) in The Atlantic reckons that Apple's new approach to textbooks is revolutionary. The reason: textbooks become personal because students can write in them and keep them even after they're done with the course. While I agree that there's some value in getting to keep a textbook forever, the fact remains that once the student leaves school, she must buy an iDevice or read it on a computer screen from iTunes. And in a world with Wikipedia, why would anyone restrict themselves to their history textbook as their sole source of information on the Mexican-American war?

In addition, the author's arguments in favor of digital textbooks are contradictory. On the one hand, she asserts thatthe Web age has de-emphasized the need to retain information and paper textbooks frame education as an "act of consumption, rather than exploration". But putting video, audio and "interactive content" (a catch-all term for stuff that lights up, jumps around and tries to make algebra seem less like work), into a medium that by its very definition has boundaries, doesn't change any of those facts.

Some textbooks are [timeless](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networks-5th-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0132126958) [classics](http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0136006639/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1). But if most learning outside school is by reading things on the open Web, shouldn't learning in schools occur through the same medium? The concept of a textbook is outdated, in my opinion. A textbook is its author's opinion of the best way to teach someone something. Putting it on an iPad doesn't change this, nor does it turn learning into "exploration". Great teachers do that. Students who ask insightful questions, and are serious about learning, do that. Engaged parents do that. 

A totally open Web isn't the answer (blocking pr0n, for instance, is important), but what about an educational search engine that is carefully curated to let students find relevant information? That's the exact opposite of a textbook on an iPad.
