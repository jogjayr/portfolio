###New York Times Blames Apple for America's Manufacturing Woes

Maverick stuff from the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all) today, as they laid out a narrative of America falling from its industrial greatness due to the flight of high-tech manufacturing to Asia. And leading the exodus, according to this narrative, was the world's most valuable technology company Apple (Designed in California&trade;). They acknowledge that Apple kept production in the family till as recently as 2002, but efficiencies and labor shortages drove them to the East.

The Times painted a terrifying picture of thousands of Chinese workers roused from their dorms at midnight by shouting, grey-uniformed, jackbooted Germans to accommodate Herr Jobs' newest demands. Many commenters described it as "slave labor" ignoring that the definition of slavery is involuntary servitude.

It's also unfair to target Apple or even the computer electronics industry. It wasn't the first industry to do it. General Electric, that stalwart of American manufacturing and symbol of American ingenuity,  started the obsession with "shareholder value"and began to offshore manufacturing in the late 70s and early 80s. For various reasons, the home appliances  industry, machine tools, steel, shipbuilding and countless others began the march out of the US long before Americans had heard  of the Internet. And even when there are opportunities for high-tech manufacturing in new industries, like solar power, the US has (cliches ahoy!) managed to shoot itself in the foot and hand the initiative to other countries.
