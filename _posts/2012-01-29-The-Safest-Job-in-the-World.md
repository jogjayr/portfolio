###Code Language for "We don't like your kind 'round here"

An [NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/us/bay-area-technology-professionals-cant-get-hired-as-industry-moves-on.html)
today reported the travails of older technology workers in Silicon Valley who find work hard to come by. Despite most
half-decent 20 year-old coders having job offers coming out of their ears and noses, older workers are discriminated against
by Web companies because many don't have the skills needed today.

The jury is out on whether older people are less adept at coding and adapting than young 'uns. Cynics will say that companies
prefer healthy 20-somethings (lower health insurance costs) with no social lives and lower salary expectations, and who grew up texting in 
Ruby on Rails (or something). Proponents of the older crowd note that programming, like most disciplines, is about 
pattern recognition and more experience means longer and more varied exposure to patterns, which means older coders are 
more productive. But that's not what we're talking about here. 

HR uses phrases like: "Are they going to get to do what they love to do for fun at work?", that people say are code-words for 
discrimination (of course no 40 year-old is going to get excited about Node.js; they think it's asinine to use a language like
Javascript, on a barely 2-year old platform). 
LinkedIn wants employees to be "entrepreneurial"; which is a bit like a zoo director saying he wants his tigers to be
"vegetarian". It's easy to see what job doesn't need you to be familiar with a dictionary, as long as you sound impressive.
