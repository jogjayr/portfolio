###Billfold Susceptible even Without "Rooting"

More accurately, it's the past couple of days as technology blogs have been quick to pounce on the fact that [Google Wallet is hackable](https://zvelo.com/blog/entry/google-wallet-security-pin-exposure-vulnerability). 

Like most alarmist "research" done these days, it comes with a caveat: the phone needs to be rooted. Or failing that [stolen phones could have pre-paid credit stolen](http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/9/2787758/second-google-wallet-security-vulnerability-confirmed-affects-all) if the thief reinstalls the Wallet app.

Google, in a [blog post](http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2012/02/protecting-your-payments-with-google.html) today, made the quite reasonable argument that manufacturers disable root access to phones for precisely reasons like this. Any user that voluntarily roots their phone should know what they are getting into. And unlike a real wallet, you can put a security code on a cell phone to prevent someone from using it even if they steal it. 

So basically what tech blogs are saying is: "Even though I'll definitely lose all my cash, credit cards and ID if my physical wallet is stolen, Google Wallet is the one that's 'vulnerable'". Gotta drive those pageviews people.

Having said that, I don't think mobile payments are such a swell idea right now, or even in the near future. Having a single point of failure makes me uncomfortable. If my battery dies or my phone is stolen, or dropped into a toilet bowl, or eaten by a bear, not only can I not call for help, I can't even pay for a cab to get me home.
