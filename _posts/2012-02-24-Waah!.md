###Exclusive: No one cares

Delightful [little tantrum](http://parislemon.com/post/18182094905/the-wall-street-journal-is-fucking-bullshit) today from noted Apple (Designed in California&trade;) fanboy, investor and blogger MG Siegler. 

I'll summarize it here as "The Wall Street Journal published an article based on a story I broke but didn't give me credit or a link. So now onwards I will do the same. And yeah, the journalist who wrote the article should join Techcrunch or PandoDaily because she's really nice." No need to thank me for saving you 5 minutes.
