###Amateur Hour is Clearly Better than the Pros

Logical reasoning is an overrated skill for Wired magazine. Mike Isaac's story [MIT, Google Release New Tools to Fix Androidâ€™s Quality-Control Problem](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/03/mit-google-release-new-tools-to-fix-androids-quality-control-problem) is an example of this.

Starting with the reasonable premise that Android apps don't look as good as iOS ones, Isaac first stretches the meaning of the word "new" while
describing Android App Inventor, considering Google originally released it well over a year ago. The only difference now is that MIT Media Lab
has taken over the project because Google couldn't be bothered to do it anymore. 

Secondly, is the absurd conclusion drawn that making Android app making accessible to more people will improve the quality of apps produced. 
NPD's Ben Arnold is even quoted as saying "It's kind of what Tumblr or Blogger has done for web development." That pretty much sums it up.

In fairness, Isaac does also mention the new Android Design guidelines website, something which will probably do a great deal more to 
advance the cause of Android app design.
