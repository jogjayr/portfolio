###What does Anecdotal Mean?

Sparkling journalism from the one-Pulitzer-a-year New York Times, as they reported that growing numbers of children of immigrants to the US are moving back to their parents' homelands in search of opportunity. People in India know this of course, thanks to Shahrukh Khan in _Swades_. But surely Mr. Khan was an exception; not many have a Gayatri Joshi waiting for them. What kind of numbers are we talking about.

In [Many U.S. Immigrantsâ€™ Children Seek American Dream Abroad](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/us/more-us-children-of-immigrants-are-leaving-us.html?pagewanted=all), Kirk Semple promises much, quoting an expert as saying "We've gone beyond anecdotal evidence."

Number of pieces of anecdotal evidence in the article: 6

Number of pieces of statistical evidence: 1 

(and that, a figure about the number of people of Indian descent that arrived in India in 2010, without regard to length of stay, purpose of visit, and with no context of past numbers given)

For shame.
