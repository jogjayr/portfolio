For the first time ever, I've decided to set some goals for the year for myself. Like most people, consciously committing to something is the best way to get it done. Here we go:

###Personal

* Learn to do at least 5 keepie-uppies with both feet and thighs
* Squat at least my own bodyweight (ie a bar loaded with as much as I weigh)
* Go on at least 5 day hikes over 10 miles
* Go camping at least 5 times
* Read at [least 20 books](/blog/reading_list.html)
* Get to level 16 in Duolingo French

###Technical

* Write a simple HTTP server in any one of: Python, JavaScript, Clojure
* Solve at least 75 exercises on HackerRank

Happy 2015 to everyone!
