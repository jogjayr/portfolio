<p>I love <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> for many reasons: it’s lightweight, small (it’s the first open-source library whose code I’ve actually completely read), super simple to get started with and has a very active community.</p>

<p>Backbone Views leave a bit to be desired because they do very little. As the <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#View">documentation</a> itself says “Backbone views are almost more convention than they are code”.</p>

<p>One particular pain point I’ve had is the inability to manage collections of views. There already exist a <a href="http://marionettejs.com/">number</a> of <a href="http://chaplinjs.org/">solutions</a> that provide you a nice way to build applications with more structure that what Backbone alone will give you. I decided to write Backbone ViewCollection for 2 reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I wanted to write it myself, to learn how</li>
  <li>A Backbone ViewCollection provides a better way of managing Backbone views while still keeping the application pure Backbone</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>What should a View Collection Do?</em></strong></p>

<p>These are the things I wanted from a View Collection class:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Renders a Backbone Collection into a Backbone View that is composed of further, child views. Each model in the collection corresponds to a child view</li>
  <li>A <code>render</code> method that calls <code>render</code> on all its child elements</li>
  <li>Handles <code>delegateEvent</code> and all the other crap associated with it</li>
  <li>Manages child view creation and destruction and prevents memory leaks or zombie views</li>
  <li>Child views can be anything - as long as they are nodes of the parent view</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an example of what such a class would do:</p>

<pre><code>var Pokemon = Backbone.Model.extend({});
var Pokedex = new Backbone.Collection({
	model: Pokemon;
 	});
 	var PokemonView = Backbone.View.extend({
	render: function() {
		//some code to render a Pokemon's info
	}
 	});
 	var PokedexView = new Backbone.ViewCollection({
	childView: PokemonView,
	collection: Pokedex
 	});
 	//This will create an instance of PokemonView for each model in
 	//the Pokedex collection and call its render() method
 	PokedexView.render();
</code></pre>

<p>In the coming blog posts, I will describe how I made my ViewCollection.</p>
