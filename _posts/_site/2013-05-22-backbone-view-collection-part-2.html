<p>In <a href="http://jayraj.net/blog/2013/05/19/backbone-view-collection-part-1">part 1</a> of this series, I explained what I wanted from a Backbone View Collection. The first and foremost thing was a common render method:</p>

<pre><code>Backbone.ViewCollection = Backbone.View.extend({
  childViews: [],
  render: function() {

    //The Backbone view class passed in that is 
    //used to generate child views
    var ItemViewClass = this.options.ItemView || Backbone.View;

    var me = this;
    _(me.collection).each(function(model, index, collection) {

    //for every model in the collection, create a new view
    var new_item_view = new ItemViewClass({model: model});

    //add it to the list of child views the collection holds
    me.childViews.push(new_item_view);

    //also add it to the view collection's own HTML element
    me.$el.append(new_item_view.$el);
   });
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This approach carries a couple of issues. The first one I faced was actually quite silly; setting <code>childViews</code> to an empty array in the class definition results in <strong>every</strong> instance of that class pointing to the same array. This is quite disastrous; all the child items of every instance of ViewCollection are added to the same array. We have to fix this, and it’s quite simple:</p>

<pre><code>Backbone.ViewCollection = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function() {
  //all the stuff we wrote above...
  },
  initialize: function() {
    //this ensures every instance of ViewCollection has a fresh array of childViews
    this.childViews = [];
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>There’s also another problem, and it has to do with how we pass <code>ItemView</code> to ViewCollection. If we were to create a new ViewCollection like so:</p>

<pre><code>var PokedexView = new Backbone.ViewCollection({
  collection: Pokedex,
  ItemView: PokemonView 
});
</code></pre>

<p>then the line:</p>

<pre><code>var ItemViewClass = this.options.ItemView || Backbone.View;
</code></pre>

<p>works perfectly. The <code>options</code> attribute of a Backbone view is composed of the object you pass into the constructor. But what if you don’t call the constructor directly? Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>var PokedexView = Backbone.ViewCollection.extend({
  collection: Pokedex
});
//a specific type of Pokedex that uses a grid layout
var PokemonGridItemView = Backbone.View.extend({});
var PokedexGridView = PokedexView.extend({
  ItemView: PokemonGridItemView
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>this.options.ItemView</code> is <code>undefined</code>. This does not bode well for being able to build complex class hierarchies with ViewCollection, so we have to modify what we wrote just a little bit:</p>

<pre><code>//Either `this` is an instance of ViewCollection, in which case ItemView is an `option`
//or `this` is an instance of a another type derived from ViewCollection
//or use the plain-old Backbone.View class
var ItemViewClass = this.options.ItemView || this.ItemView || Backbone.View;
</code></pre>

<p>Same thing applies for collection. So</p>

<pre><code>_(me.collection).each(...)
</code></pre>

<p>won’t work every time.</p>

<p>Having learned all this, here’s ViewCollection now:</p>

<pre><code>Backbone.ViewCollection = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function() {

    //The Backbone view class passed in that is 
    //used to generate child views
    var ItemViewClass = this.options.ItemView || this.ItemView || Backbone.View;
    var collection = this.options.collection || this.collection;
    var me = this;
    _(collection).each(function(model, index, collection) {

      //for every model in the collection, create a new view
      var new_item_view = new ItemViewClass({model: model});

      //add it to the list of child views the collection holds
      me.childViews.push(new_item_view);

      //also add it to the view collection's own HTML element
      me.$el.append(new_item_view.$el);
    });
  },
  initialize: function() {
    this.childViews = [];
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>To be continued…</p>
