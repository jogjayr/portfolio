<p>I now have a <a href="/blog/reading_list.html">reading list</a> on my blog.</p>

<p>As you can see, it’s divided into fiction and non-fiction, with non-fiction further divided into technical and non-technical books.</p>

<p>I have a mental list of books that I want to read, but always draw a blank when I’m actually at the library. This list will help with that.</p>

<p>The first book I read on the list was <i>On Writing</i> by Stephen King. I’ve read plenty of fiction by Stephen King. Some good (<i>Everything’s Eventual</i>, <i>The Dead Zone</i>, <i>The Running Man</i>, the sometimes sappy <i>Hearts in Atlantis</i>), and some very forgettable (<i>The Regulators</i>, <i>The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon</i>). So I’ve been meaning to hear the great man talk about his craft. He did not disappoint me. But now, in his classification of writers (great, good, competent, bad), I worry that I am one of the bad ones. The ones who he says can never become competent.</p>

<p>The reading list page also has Amazon.com referral links. I don’t really need the money; it’s just a way of keeping score. I will donate any cash I make from the page to the <a href="http://eff.com">EFF</a>.</p>
