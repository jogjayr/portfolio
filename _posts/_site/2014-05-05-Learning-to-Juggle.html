<p>In January of this year, I started learning how to juggle.</p>

<p>I work at <a href="http://bittorrent.com">BitTorrent</a>, where it appears there’s a bit of a juggling culture. Actually, I don’t know if that’s true, but <strong>everyone</strong> here seems to juggle. I think it starts from the top; I’ve seen Bram Cohen juggle 5 balls.</p>

<p>I always thought I lacked the co-ordination to learn to juggle, but it turns out I’d been doing it wrong. I checked out <a href="link">this Youtube video</a> where the guy explains that the simplest method to learn is the 3-ball cascade. Most beginners try to do a pattern where they pass the ball underhand. Although this seems like the most obvious way to juggle, it’s actually really hard.</p>

<p>The cascade style is easy to pick up, once you’ve developed the muscle memory. Just do what the guy in the video says and you’ll be juggling within 3 to 4 weeks.</p>
