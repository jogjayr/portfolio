  <li>Go on at least 5 day hikes over 10 miles</li>
  <li>Go camping at least 5 times</li>
  <li>Read at <a href="/blog/reading_list.html">least 20 books</a></li>
  <li>Get to level 16 in Duolingo French</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Write a simple HTTP server in any one of: Python, JavaScript, Clojure</li>
