###Friedman wades into the jobs vs tech debate

Thomas Friedman of the New York Times displayed a masterclass today in phoning it in. 

In his column titled [Average is Over](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/opinion/friedman-average-is-over.html), he first
explained that technology has been eating away at many jobs (like it has done for the past 100 years) and that this has
gotten even faster in the last 10.

Then he trots out this revolutionary idea that anyone of average talent and skill is doomed to dim professional prospects. Now there's some 
sound career advice kids. And it's not like [Business Insider reported Seth Godin saying the exact same thing](http://www.businessinsider.com/if-youre-an-average-worker-in-this-forever-recession-youre-going-straight-to-the-bottom-2012-1) 
a week ago. Wait...

Additionally, as a commenter on the column points out, it's mathematically impossible for EVERYONE to be above average. That means
that a significant portion of the population are going to be stuck in menial jobs forever. In fairness to Friedman, he may
have meant "above average" when considering the entire world's population. Getting a degree in English from the Southern Arkansas University (no offense)
may not make you above average in the US (or even Arkansas), but still puts you pretty high up the chain when considering the entire world's
workforce. Now if only graduates of the Southern Arkansas University could move to China...
