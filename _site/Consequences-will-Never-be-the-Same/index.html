<p>Counter-terrorism expert and writer Richard A. Clarke served up some wonderful BS today. In an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/opinion/how-china-steals-our-secrets.html">Op-Ed</a> piece for the New York Times, he held forth on the number of trade secrets and technology American companies are losing to hackers. Quoting Gen. Keith B Alexander, he calls it “the greatest transfer of wealth in history”.</p>

<p>This is where he starts sounding less like an “expert” and more like the “Consequences Will Never Be the Same” dad. What he suggests is patent nonsense: “the United States government could stop files in the process of being stolen from getting to the Chinese hackers”, by having the DHS scan every file coming in and going out, a la a cyber customs force.</p>

<p>Firstly, if it was that simple, piracy wouldn’t exist. If ordinary people can get <i>Game of Thrones</i> for free from foreign websites, it’s reasonable to assume skilled Chinese uber-hackers could do the reverse without much trouble, no matter who’s watching the pipes. Then there’s also the issue of the DHS having to install filters on every line in and out, maintain a database of “sensitive files” which they would have to amass from companies, who need to be comfortable putting proprietary information into the hands of a government body that’s no more likely to be secure than the companies themselves. The whole idea of a government cyber border patrol manning a nation’s digital frontiers is laughable; an idea from the original <i>Tron</i> or <i>VR Troopers</i>.</p>

<p>There isn’t a single idea in this whole enterprise that doesn’t have a faint touch of the ridiculous. From gems like: “If government agencies were authorized to create a major program to grab stolen data leaving the country, they could drastically reduce today’s wholesale theft of American corporate secrets”, to the only flaw in the plan being “privacy advocates”. The only person who stands to benefit from any such legislation is Richard A Clarke himself. An expert like him could stand to mint a small fortune from consulting engagements, if such legislation or executive orders were considered. It seems about par for a man who has Amazon affiliate links to his own book on his own <a href="http://www.richardaclarke.net/">website</a> (seriously, who does that?).</p>

<p>Interestingly, Mr. Clarke unwittingly offers a much simpler solution himself. He notes that the SEC recommends companies to disclose breaches in security. Perhaps it should be made mandatory. The only ways to get CEOs to pay attention to regulatory issues are the threat of jail time, or a drop in the stock price. Repeated breaches, when revealed by force of SEC regulation, will do plenty to ensure the latter.</p>
