<p>Gawker’s <a href="http://gawker.com/5901613">Ryan Tate</a> dug into <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/04/05/an-open-letter-to-randi-zuckerberg-how-could-you-do-this-to-real-entrepreneurs/">Sarah Lacey</a> and the rest of Silicon Valley, saying what the rest of us know already; they’re dying to become famous.</p>

<p>Leaving out the irony of a website that unflinchingly employs provocative titles to drive page views to basically tame pieces of fluff accusing someone else of attention-seeking behaviour, there is a kernel of truth in this. Lacey’s attack on Randi Zuckerberg’s upcoming reality TV show was pointless for a number of reasons. Just because she worked at Facebook and her brother built it, doesn’t make she’s “selling out” Silicon Valley. Who cares how tech companies are depicted on TV? Does it really matter if companies in the Valley are shown partying and taking off their shirts all the time?</p>

<p>Of course, Gawker being Gawker, they had to be “reliably informed” that Lacey tried and failed to create her own tech reality TV show. The obvious conclusion to be drawn (if you work at Gawker), is that anyone who attacks Zuckerberg’s show really just wants the fame for themselves.</p>

<p>This blog thinks they should all shut up and get back to work. And let Zuckerberg do her job.</p>
