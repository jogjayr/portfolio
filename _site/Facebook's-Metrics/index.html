    <h3>It&#39;s All Semantics Really</h3>

<p><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/those-millions-on-facebook-some-may-not-actually-visit/">Andrew Ross Sorkin</a>
was freaking out over Facebook&#39;s claims that it has 483 million active users everyday, implying it was disingenuous. The reason: Facebook counts &quot;Like&quot;-ing or sharing via the &quot;Share on Facebook&quot; button as being active on Facebook. Since these people don&#39;t see any ads, they don&#39;t make revenue directly for FB.</p>

<p>Firstly, am I really more active if I login to Facebook and paste a link into my status update (theoretically, since I don&#39;t have an account), than if I click on the Share button from the article directly? Sorkin concedes that even non-FB domain engagement is valuable information to FB but insists that investors deserve to also have signed-in user numbers. IMHO, it&#39;s really not that big of a deal, except to stock analysts who want to seem like they&#39;re doing more work by examining another metric. It&#39;s entirely possible for Facebook to roll out an AdSense-style advertising network, making it irrelevant whether users actually visit Facebook.com. Speaking of which, how come Facebook doesn&#39;t have something like AdSense? Or is it just my small minded-ness to think AdSense is still relevant?</p>

<h3>Could this mean free porn forever?</h3>

<p>A California woman&#39;s fight against the copyright mafia shakedown has brought to light an interesting legal question: can porn be copyrighted at all?</p>

<p>I must admit the headline, <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/you-cant-copyright-porn-bittorrent-defendant-insists-120206/">You Can&#39;t Copyright Porn, Harassed BitTorrent Defendant Insists</a>, had me thinking of those people who upload Taylor Swift songs to Youtube and write &quot;No copyrights intented[sic]&quot;. Instead, Liuxia Wong of California, who was told that a copyright infringement lawsuit for allegedly pirating Hard Drive productions&#39; cinematic masterpiece <em>Amateur Allure Jen</em> could go away for $3400, fought back with a stunning claim: porn can&#39;t be copyrighted.</p>

<p>Copyright was intended &quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot;, and a California circuit court ruled that &quot;obscene works did not promote the progress of science and art&quot; (would love to see a link to this judgement somewhere, but the article did not say). If you put 2 and 2 together, this seems to imply that porn can&#39;t be copyrighted. Now it&#39;s unlikely that such a judgement will ever come to pass, so I think the most likely outcome is Hard Drive productions slinking away, tail between legs. </p>
