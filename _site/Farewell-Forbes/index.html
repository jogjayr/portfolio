<p>Adam Hartung did a number on Sony on Forbes.com. In an article titled <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2012/04/20/sayonara-sony-how-industrial-mba-style-leadership-killed-once-great-company/">Sayonara Sony: How Industrial, MBA-style Leadership Killed a Once Great Company</a>, he first talked about Sony’s past glories, and why they’re struggling now. But his article doesn’t hold up to logical scrutiny at all. (Beware: Long post ahead)</p>

<p>First, Sony’s achievements:</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sony improved solid state transistor radios until they surpassed the quality of tubes, making good quality sound available very reliably, and inexpensively</li>

<li>Sony developed the solid state television, replacing tubes to make TVs more reliable, better working and use less energy</li>

<li>Sony developed the Triniton television tube, which dramatically improved the quality of color (yes Virginia, once TV was all in black &amp; white) and enticed an entire generation to switch. Sony also expanded the size of Trinitron to make larger sets that better fit larger homes</li>

<li>Sony was an early developer of videotape technology, pioneering the market with Betamax before losing a battle with JVC to be the standard (yes Virginia, we once watched movies on tape)</li>

<li>Sony pioneered the development of camcorders, for the first time turning parents – and everyone – into home movie creators</li>

<li>Sony pioneered the development of independent mobile entertainment by creating the Walkman, which allowed – for the first time – people to take their own recorded music with them, via cassette tapes</li>

<li>Sony pioneered the development of compact discs for music, and developed the Walkman CD for portable use</li>

<li>Sony gave us the Playstation, which went far beyond Nintendo in creating the products that excited users and made “home gaming” a market.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Hartung argues that a lack of product vision, and management by numbers has led to the company’s downfall. Here he blames Japanese industrial culture, which focused on improving manufacturing processes and reducing costs, but led to little innovation elsewhere. Quite how Sony made all their technological breakthroughs (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling#History">research</a> that led to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Esaki">Nobel prize</a>) if they were complicit in this “neglect research, lower costs” mentality, is left unexplained. In addition, Sony prided itself on selling quality goods at a premium. Sure, they pursued manufacturing and supply-chain improvements, much like Apple does today, but the savings only bolstered their already heaving margins. In this, they distinguished themselves from other Japanese companies of the era. They also ruthlessly dumped businesses with low margins, such as pocket calculators (a decision Morita bemoaned later in his autobiography, because it put Sony back when the age of computers began).</p>

<p>Next he goes on to point out Sony’s history of pushing proprietary formats: Betamax, ATRAC (which Hartung calls Sony MP3, for some reason), and most recently, Blu-ray. He fails to mention the CD-ROM standard, on which Sony collaborated with Philips. He also forgets that once Betamax died, Sony happily got behind VHS and sold VCRs for many years, even winning the landmark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_shifting">time-shifting</a> judgement from the US Supreme Court. So even losing a format war in the past didn’t hinder the selling of products.</p>

<p>Finally, ex-CEO Howard Stringer gets it in the neck for cutting costs and laying off people. It may be true that Stringer might not have been what the company needed culturally or from a “big picture” standpoint. But the Sony he took over had become an unwieldy, unfocused giant with too many businesses and units (what the hell were they doing selling insurance and renting helicopters?). It could be argued that the company needed a dose of discipline (not at the expense of innovation).</p>

<p>In my opinion, the real reason Sony is struggling is that they never “got” the age of computers. They remained stuck in their ways of producing pretty-looking gadgets that were as sleek and small as possible (sound familiar?), without realizing that these gadgets could now be full-featured computers, with software on them. For that matter, I don’t think they’ve ever really understood software or the Internet. These things came after the company’s initial successes, and not many of the early employees studied at American universities, or worked at American corporations that were performing research on the Internet, Unix and C. I don’t think Sony ever saw themselves as a pure consumer electronics company either, seemingly attempting to model themselves on the likes of GE (especially when you look at their disparate businesses), RCA or other Japanese conglomerates. Having missed the information age boat once, they then proceeded to do so again, with the mobile age, choosing to partner with Ericsson and giving the whole setup some stepmotherly treatment.</p>

<p>Having fallen behind technologically in a very important area (software), they also neglected one of their core strengths: industrial design. The Walkman, the Trinitron TV or the first “pocketable” transistor radio were stunning achievements of industrial design in consumer electronics. Why don’t we see that anymore from Sony? It could be, as Hartung claims, because of cost-cutting, but it could also be because they no longer have a product-focused CEO like Morita, or his successor Norio Ohga. In this at least, Hartung is correct.</p>
