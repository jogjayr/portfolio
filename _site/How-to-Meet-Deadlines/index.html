<p>Dan Frommer decided to write a story about what everyone else knows; Google is scared of Facebook.</p>

<p>This isn’t news to anybody really. Therefore, quite why he felt the need to write a story titled <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_facebook_terrifies_google.php">Why Facebook Terrifies Google</a> is beyond this blog. Because it’s really quite simple: people spend more time on Facebook, Facebook knows more about those people, Facebook can serve better ads.</p>

<p>Sure it’s nice to include a few screenshots from FB’s ad creation interface, to demonstrate what kind of targeting can be done. But if the bar for what is “news” has been lowered to this level, expect a piece on how SourceForge is changing the world of open-source softwa…oh.</p>

<h3 id="what_does_anecdotal_mean">What does Anecdotal Mean?</h3>

<p>Sparkling journalism from the one-Pulitzer-a-year New York Times, as they reported that growing numbers of children of immigrants to the US are moving back to their parents’ homelands in search of opportunity. People in India know this of course, thanks to Shahrukh Khan in <em>Swades</em>. But surely Mr. Khan was an exception; not many have a Gayatri Joshi waiting for them. What kind of numbers are we talking about.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/us/more-us-children-of-immigrants-are-leaving-us.html?pagewanted=all">Many U.S. Immigrants’ Children Seek American Dream Abroad</a>, Kirk Semple promises much, quoting an expert as saying “We’ve gone beyond anecdotal evidence.”</p>

<p>Number of pieces of anecdotal evidence in the article: 6</p>

<p>Number of pieces of statistical evidence: 1</p>

<p>(and that, a figure about the number of people of Indian descent that arrived in India in 2010, without regard to length of stay, purpose of visit, and with no context of past numbers given)</p>

<p>For shame.</p>
