  <h3 id="startups__conspiracy_or_extended_hackathon">Startups - Conspiracy or Extended Hackathon?</h3>

<p>Hard-hitting stuff from <a href="http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2012/02/the_dirty_littl_1.php">Tom Forenski and Silicon Valley Watcher</a> as they expose the current startup mania (which this writer is a part of), as nothing more than an elaborate front for recruiting tech talent and making their investors rich, writing: “Just one $25 million payday from the sale of a startup will more than cover an Angel investor’s loss from a hundred dud $25K investments”</p>

<p>He does close on a heartwarming, cheer-the-underdog note by adding:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Silicon Valley’s dirty little secret is that the startup boom is mostly a disguised jobs fair that directly benefits the big corporations. &gt; Occasionally, an innovative startup makes it past this stage but it has to be so bad that no one wants it – not even for its team. It’s &gt; from among those ugly ducklings that the swans of the new age emerge: FB, Goog, Twitter, Yahoo! and others – no one wanted them at first, &gt; then they couldn’t get enough of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This last bit is slightly disingenuous. None of the companies mentioned above were shunned because of a lack of engineering talent; instead it was their (apparent) lack of a revenue model that made investors wary. Good job otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="lolwut_story_of_the_day">Lolwut? Story of the Day</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-03/facebook-punters-put-shares-at-35-with-bono-ringing-bell.html">Reports</a> of Facebook’s IPO price being the subject of bets by leading UK bookmaker Paddy Power sounds odd on the face of it.</p>

<p>Why would someone bet on the price of a security at a bookmaker’s when they can just do it in the real market? Granted, it’s a bet on the issue price, which is the one price set, not by the open market, but by what Facebook’s bankers think will move the most paper. But it still seems slightly backward and redundant to place bets on stock prices with a bookie, when you can do the same with a broker.</p>

<h3 id="pirates_are_romantic_figures">Pirates ARE Romantic Figures</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120126/09565417551/why-piracy-is-indispensable-survival-our-culture.shtml">Quick line about this article</a> from pirate-sympathizers Techdirt, who argue that DRM will logically result in a loss of our digital heritage as archivists are unable to preserve the past. History will thank the pirates for doing their thing. Fight the man. We shall overcome.</p>
