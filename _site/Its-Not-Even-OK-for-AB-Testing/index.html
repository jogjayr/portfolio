    <h3>You&#39;re Not You When You&#39;re Being Paid By Someone Else</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>You’re not you when you’re hungry @<a href="https://twitter.com/snickersUk">snickersUk</a>#hungry#spon   <a href="http://t.co/PUZnINcl" title="http://lockerz.com/s/177408824">lockerz.com/s/177408824</a></p>&mdash; Rio Ferdinand (@rioferdy5) <a href="https://twitter.com/rioferdy5/status/161840144628973568" data-datetime="2012-01-24T15:57:51+00:00">January 24, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>Rio Ferdinand of Manchester United (sigh) was responsible for a storm in a tempest (shield your eyes if you expect cliches used correctly) 
today when he promoted a Snickers bar on his Twitter feed. </p>

<p>Paul Sawers at <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/01/28/brands-may-be-paying-celebrities-for-tweets-but-whos-paying-twitter/">The Next Web</a>
wrote that the UK authorities might have a problem with any implied (ie, not explicit) endorsement as being unfair. It&#39;s safe to say that
won&#39;t happen (as many commenters on the post pointed out), because of the #spon hashtag, coupled with the fact that it was so out
of the ordinary for Rio (sample tweet: &quot;Morning tweeps! Back from training! Wazza in my #pocket. #stayonyourfeet #piershasmoobs&quot;)</p>

<p>Unless Rio was doing this for charity, it&#39;s also worth wondering how much Snickers paid him to piss off his 2 million followers.
And pissed off they were. It must be a lot, because he&#39;s one of the highest paid players in the Premier League.</p>

<h3>Fight! Fight! Fight!</h3>

<p>YC-backed Curebit were caught red-handed being very naughty. The firm&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/allangrant">Allan Grant</a>
was embroiled in a pitched Twitter battle with RoR creator <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dhh">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> 
(whose middle name is the answer to the question: &quot;What should I do if I get 4 Es and 2 Is in Scrabble?&quot;) about copied 
HTML code, design and even (shamefully) hot-linked images from one of Hansson&#39;s 37Signals sites (or something like that).</p>

<p>Grant started off defensive (&quot;we&#39;re a small company&quot;), then quickly discovered that the leg he thought he had to stand on (he&#39;d hot-linked to this leg too)
did not exist (it started 404-ing). With the tide of popular Intertweets opinion turning against him, he quickly capitulated
(or at least, pretended to). For me, this has ended in disappointing fashion. Hansson is a racecar driver and who wouldn&#39;t have
paid to see the two of them race down the Golden Gate Bridge to settle this? 
(give me a break, I don&#39;t know jack about SFO&#39;s geography). </p>
