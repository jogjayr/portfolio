<p>In the vastness of the frozen north, the Republic of Imaginary Millions’ (RIM) Politburo selected Thorsten Heins as their general secretary. Heins replaces Jim Balsille, one of the founding fathers of the Republic, and Mike Lazaridis. Like his predecessors, Heins, retains his firm belief in the nation’s destiny, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/at-research-in-motion-a-new-ceo-vows-to-silence-the-doomsayers/article2310968/">declaring</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s a fantastic growth story and it’s not coming to an end. What you will see with me is rigour and flawless execution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RIM is a major exporter of fruit, primarily Blackberries. Unfortunately, the world’s demand for Blackberries has slumped even as the market for fruit, especially Apples, has grown. The embattled nation has had to face defections, <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/06/30/open-letter-to-blackberry-bosses-senior-rim-exec-tells-all-as-company-crumbles-around-him/">public shamings</a> and the draining of its treasury. Although some developing nations, such as India, are still pursuing <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/01/09/leaked-memo-claims-phone-companies-let-india-spy-on-u-s-emails/">strategic security alliances</a> with the Republic, and even buying their old hardware, most of the Western world regards the nation as a power in terminal decline.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Mr. Heins (hereafter, known as Dear Leader), will be able to breathe life back into the Republic of Imaginary Millions.</p>

<p>Like ants from a broken anthill, file-sharing sites are scrambling to get out of the Justice Department and Big Content’s giant cross-hairs. The two have declared war on every single website and service that offers file uploading and downloading, leaving the likes <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/filesonic-kills-file-sharing-after-megaupload-arrests-120122/">Filesonic</a> quivering in their boots. Filesonic has suspended file download capability, allowing users to only access their personal files.</p>

<p>This explains why Today I Read couldn’t download the latest installment of Dr. Do-me-a-little. For research.</p>

<h3 id="joel_spolskys_sopasmart_idea">Joel Spolsky’s SOPA-smart idea</h3>

<p>StackOverflow and FogCreek Software founder, and software writer <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117114202722218150209/posts/4GgaRiSyaTf">Joel Spolsky</a> offered possibly some of the best solutions to SOPA/PIPA.</p>

<p>Specifically, he proposed a counter-attack by lobbying to abolish software patents, introduce punitive legislation for patent trolls, enshrine linking to content in a law protecting free speech, and also called on Web companies who want to support pro-them candidates to offer free advertisement, so that they aren’t so beholden to other people for campaign funding. In my opinion, that last one is just a different way of funding campaigns, and it’s not difficult to see a future where Google would call a majority of the shots through Youtube. Or, in an ironic twist, the content providers might get the last laugh by employing Hulu for this purpose.</p>

<p>Either way, it’s good to see that someone’s looking for a positive reaction to the whole thing, instead of resigning the industry to fight the MPAA every couple of years.</p>
