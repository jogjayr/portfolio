    <h3>&quot;Deleted&quot; Doesn&#39;t Really Mean Deleted? Well, duh.</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/07/the-austrian-thorn-in-facebooks-side/">Forbes.com&#39;s</a> Kashmir Hill shone the spotlight on one Max Schrems, a 24-year-old Austrian law student and privacy activist. When he takes a break from dancing to polka tunes, drinking coffee with chocolate, eating wiener schnitzels, and telling his Facebook friends that he did these things, Schrems cracks open his massive tomes on European privacy law to find new ways to harass Facebook.</p>

<p>It all began very simply for young Max when he studied at Santa Clara University for a semester and learned that Facebook&#39;s lawyers knew precisely f*ck-all about privacy law in Europe. He also found an obscure page on Facebook where European users can get every bit of info that Facebook has about them, as per the law on the Continent. Upon submitting a copy of his passport, driver&#39;s license, birth certificate, scuba certification and even a hairdresser&#39;s license that they made him get for this express purpose, Schrems received a thousand (1000) page file with all his information. He said it was like the Stasi&#39;s files, because of the detail and scope of the information.</p>

<p>What vexed our young crusader the most is that some pieces of info had been tagged as &quot;[DELETED]&quot; but Facebook clearly still had them. He feels this is an outrage. Max, I don&#39;t know if you know how the Internet works, but Facebook provides this wonderful service, that costs a lot to operate, for free. In return for this, they will log every single thing you do on their platform, and keep it for all eternity. Call it the new social contract for the Internet. If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t do anything you don&#39;t want others to know on Facebook. Or just stop using Facebook. </p>

<h3>Google to Pay You for Your Information</h3>

<p>And it&#39;s about damn time too. Google&#39;s new <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/screenwisepanel/">Screenwise</a> program offers Amazon gift certificates in return for letting Google watch your every move through their Chrome browser. I guess it&#39;s cool for those who are OK with it and really want the gift certificates. Though one does wonder if there&#39;s a minimum usage requirement. I mean, what if I sign up, but only use Firefox to browse the Web?</p>
