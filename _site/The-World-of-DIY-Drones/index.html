  <h3 id="these_aint_your_older_siblings_drones">These Ain’t Your Older Sibling’s Drones</h3>

<p>Today, I took my first steps into the world of DIY drones. Saw a link on a colleague’s GChat status (thanks Andrew!) - <a href="http://tacocopter.com">tacocopter.com</a>. I still don’t know if they’re for real, but this West coast startup purports to deliver tacos using flying robots.</p>

<p>I dove headlong into the world of DIY drones to find out if it was possible. Turns out, information is really sparse on the ground (weak laugh). <a href="https://code.google.com/p/arducopter/">Arducopter</a> is a hotbed of activity; an open-source UAV autopilot project. This thing is ridiculously futuristic-sounding: “scripted waypoints, GPS, sonar sensor for automated takeoff and landing capability”. And it starts at $600!</p>

<p>With a theoretical range of 4km in some configurations, and minimum payload capabilities of 500gm (although these two figures were obtained separately, so I don’t know if both are possible), food delivery using drones is tantalizingly within reach of the existing technology. It just needs a determined startup to max out these capabilities, solve the security problems, set up charging stations (maybe on cellphone towers?) and provide food delivery as a service (FDaS?) to restaurants. So restaurants can focus on doing what they do best: making the food. The drone flies in, picks up the food, drops it off and zips back to its charging station.</p>

<p>When you think about it, using an entire car and person to deliver a single parcel of food is rather wasteful.</p>

<p>Regulatory issues will undoubtedly crop up. The FAA will get involved. And of course, the potential for lawsuits when a drone inevitably falls out of the sky and conks somebody in head.</p>

<p>UPDATE: What you inevitably get for posting too early: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/arducopter/">Tacocopter is a fake service</a> and the article confirms my suspicions that the regulatory and safety issues make this nearly impossible in the near future. Shame.</p>
