  <h3 id="feds_will_soon_approve_shooting_through_hostages">Feds will Soon Approve Shooting Through Hostages</h3>

<p>In the continuing fallout from the Megaupload takedown, the feds have essentially told users: “We don’t care about your treasured memories and important work documents”</p>

<p>Megaupload is unable to pay its hosting bills due to their assets being frozen, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/feds_to_megaupload_users_tough_luck.php">ReadWriteWeb reported today</a>. Because of payment defaults, their hosting company may soon start deleting data. And since the government wasn’t given search warrants for Megaupload’s users’ files, they can’t back them up either. The bottomline: if someone doesn’t change their minds soon, people are going to lose stuff.</p>

<p>Blaming users for storing their files on Megaupload is like blaming injured innocent bystanders in a shootout between cops and drug dealers: “Well obviously, you shouldn’t have been walking through such a dangerous neighbourhood.” To those who say it’s not right to compare a computer user losing files to a 13-year old getting shot on the way to school, I would say that it’s also not right to compare drug dealing with someone illicitly downloading the odd movie or song. If society has decided that it’s not right to put innocent lives at risk when pursuing suspects of heinous crimes, then it follows that it’s not right to put innocent files at risk when pursuing suspects of copyright crimes.</p>
