   <title>Backbone View Collection - Part 2</title>
   <link href="http://jayraj.net/2013/05/22/backbone-view-collection-part-2"/>
   <updated>2013-05-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>hhttp://jayraj.net/2013/05/22/backbone-view-collection-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;span&gt;part 1&lt;/span&gt; of this series, I explained what I wanted from a Backbone View Collection. The first and foremost thing was a common render method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Backbone.ViewCollection = Backbone.View.extend({
	childViews: [],
	render: function() {

		//The Backbone view class passed in that is 
		//used to generate child views
		var ItemViewClass = this.options.ItemView || Backbone.View;

		var me = this;
		_(me.collection).each(function(model, index, collection) {

			//for every model in the collection, create a new view
			var new_item_view = new ItemViewClass({model: model});

			//add it to the list of child views the collection holds
			me.childViews.push(new_item_view);

			//also add it to the view collection&amp;#39;s own HTML element
			me.$el.append(new_item_view.$el);
		});
	}
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach carries a couple of issues. The first one I faced was actually quite silly; setting &lt;code&gt;childViews&lt;/code&gt; to an empty array in the class definition results in &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; instance of that class pointing to the same array. This is quite disastrous; all the child items of every instance of ViewCollection are added to the same array. We have to fix this, and it&amp;#8217;s quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Backbone.ViewCollection = Backbone.View.extend({
	render: function() {
		//all the stuff we wrote above...
	},
	initialize: function() {
		//this ensures every instance of ViewCollection has a fresh array of childViews
		this.childViews = [];
	}
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also another problem, and it has to do with how we pass &lt;code&gt;ItemView&lt;/code&gt; to ViewCollection. If we were to create a new ViewCollection like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var PokedexView = new Backbone.ViewCollection({
	collection: Pokedex,
	ItemView: PokemonView 
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then the line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var ItemViewClass = this.options.ItemView || Backbone.View;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;works perfectly. The &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; attribute of a Backbone view is composed of the object you pass into the constructor. But what if you don&amp;#8217;t call the constructor directly? Consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var PokedexView = Backbone.ViewCollection.extend({
	collection: Pokedex
});
//a specific type of Pokedex that uses a grid layout
var PokemonGridItemView = Backbone.View.extend({});
var PokedexGridView = PokedexView.extend({
	ItemView: PokemonGridItemView
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;code&gt;this.options.ItemView&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;. This does not bode well for being able to build complex class hierarchies with ViewCollection, so we have to modify what we wrote just a little bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;//Either `this` is an instance of ViewCollection, in which case ItemView is an `option`
//or `this` is an instance of a another type derived from ViewCollection
//or use the plain-old Backbone.View class
var ItemViewClass = this.options.ItemView || this.ItemView || Backbone.View;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same thing applies for collection. So&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;_(me.collection).each(...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;won&amp;#8217;t work every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having learned all this, here&amp;#8217;s ViewCollection now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Backbone.ViewCollection = Backbone.View.extend({
	render: function() {

		//The Backbone view class passed in that is 
		//used to generate child views
		var ItemViewClass = this.options.ItemView || this.ItemView || Backbone.View;
		var collection = this.options.collection || this.collection;
		var me = this;
		_(collection).each(function(model, index, collection) {

			//for every model in the collection, create a new view
			var new_item_view = new ItemViewClass({model: model});

			//add it to the list of child views the collection holds
			me.childViews.push(new_item_view);

			//also add it to the view collection&amp;#39;s own HTML element
			me.$el.append(new_item_view.$el);
		});
	},
	initialize: function() {
		this.childViews = [];
	}
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Backbone View Collection - Part 1</title>
   <link href="http://jayraj.net/2013/05/19/backbone-view-collection-part-1"/>
   <updated>2013-05-19T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>hhttp://jayraj.net/2013/05/19/backbone-view-collection-part-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href='http://backbonejs.org'&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt; for many reasons: it&amp;#8217;s lightweight, small (it&amp;#8217;s the first open-source library whose code I&amp;#8217;ve actually completely read), super simple to get started with and has a very active community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backbone Views leave a bit to be desired because they do very little. As the &lt;a href='http://backbonejs.org/#View'&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; itself says &amp;#8220;Backbone views are almost more convention than they are code&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particular pain point I&amp;#8217;ve had is the inability to manage collections of views. There already exist a &lt;a href='http://marionettejs.com/'&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href='http://chaplinjs.org/'&gt;solutions&lt;/a&gt; that provide you a nice way to build applications with more structure that what Backbone alone will give you. I decided to write Backbone ViewCollection for 2 reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to write it myself, to learn how&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A Backbone ViewCollection provides a better way of managing Backbone views while still keeping the application pure Backbone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What should a View Collection Do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the things I wanted from a View Collection class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renders a Backbone Collection into a Backbone View that is composed of further, child views. Each model in the collection corresponds to a child view&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; method that calls &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; on all its child elements&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Handles &lt;code&gt;delegateEvent&lt;/code&gt; and all the other crap associated with it&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Manages child view creation and destruction and prevents memory leaks or zombie views&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Child views can be anything - as long as they are nodes of the parent view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of what such a class would do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var Pokemon = Backbone.Model.extend({});
var Pokedex = new Backbone.Collection({
	model: Pokemon;
});
var PokemonView = Backbone.View.extend({
	render: function() {
		//some code to render a Pokemon&amp;#39;s info
	}
});
var PokedexView = new Backbone.ViewCollection({
	childView: PokemonView,
	collection: Pokedex
});
//This will create an instance of PokemonView for each model in
//the Pokedex collection and call its render() method
PokedexView.render();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming blog posts, I will describe how I made my ViewCollection.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='a_rock_and_a_hard_place'&gt;A Rock and a Hard Place&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T head honcho Randall Stephenson put his foot in his mouth on Wednesday, May 2, while demonstrating his commitment to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/gcprogram.taf?function=detail&amp;amp;EvID=3314&amp;amp;eventid=GC12'&gt;At a conference&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the &lt;a href='http://www.milkeninstitute.org'&gt;Milken institute&lt;/a&gt; the New York Times &lt;a href='http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/att-randall-stephenson/'&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Stephenson bemoaning the decision to give iPhone users all-you-can-eat data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only regret was how we introduced pricing in the beginning, because how did we introduce pricing? Thirty dollars and you get all you can eat. And it’s a variable cost model. Every additional megabyte you use in this network, I have to invest capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much sympathy for him there. The iPhone was exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T for 4 years. People who hated AT&amp;amp;T would become subscribers because of the iPhone. And when its massive data sucking caused dropped calls for everyone, people not only put up with it, they &lt;em&gt;bought their own mini cell towers and operated them at their own cost&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not content with pissing off the masses with his griping about having to spend so fuckin&amp;#8217; much to provide service to his customers, Stephenson railed about the unfairness of it all, with iMessage eating into his sweet, sweet texting margins. Woe is me, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You lie awake at night worrying about what is that which will disrupt your business model. Apple iMessage is a classic example. If you’re using iMessage, you’re not using one of our messaging services, right? That’s disruptive to our messaging revenue stream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That clearly didn&amp;#8217;t go down well with commenters on the article either. Because text messages are so ridiculously lucrative for carriers, and carry such high margins, it&amp;#8217;s not even funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randall Stephenson was speaking at an industry conference surrounded by fellow worshippers of capitalism (the Milken institute &amp;#8220;believes in the power of capital markets to solve urgent social and economic challenges and improve lives&amp;#8221;). His remarks were clearly right for the setting, and right by his shareholders, but he might&amp;#8217;ve stopped to consider the impression formed with a broader audience, who clearly see this as greedy bellyaching. (Just see the comments on the article)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Farewell Forbes</title>
   <link href="http://jayraj.net/links/2012/04/21/WIRT"/>
   <updated>2012-04-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>hhttp://jayraj.net/links/2012/04/21/WIRT</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='hoping_it_will_be_proved_wrong'&gt;Hoping it will be Proved Wrong&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Hartung did a number on Sony on Forbes.com. In an article titled &lt;a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2012/04/20/sayonara-sony-how-industrial-mba-style-leadership-killed-once-great-company/'&gt;Sayonara Sony: How Industrial, MBA-style Leadership Killed a Once Great Company&lt;/a&gt;, he first talked about Sony&amp;#8217;s past glories, and why they&amp;#8217;re struggling now. But his article doesn&amp;#8217;t hold up to logical scrutiny at all. (Beware: Long post ahead)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Sony&amp;#8217;s achievements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sony improved solid state transistor radios until they surpassed the quality of tubes, making good quality sound available very reliably, and inexpensively&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sony developed the solid state television, replacing tubes to make TVs more reliable, better working and use less energy&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sony developed the Triniton television tube, which dramatically improved the quality of color (yes Virginia, once TV was all in black &amp;amp; white) and enticed an entire generation to switch. Sony also expanded the size of Trinitron to make larger sets that better fit larger homes&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sony was an early developer of videotape technology, pioneering the market with Betamax before losing a battle with JVC to be the standard (yes Virginia, we once watched movies on tape)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sony pioneered the development of camcorders, for the first time turning parents – and everyone – into home movie creators&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sony pioneered the development of independent mobile entertainment by creating the Walkman, which allowed – for the first time – people to take their own recorded music with them, via cassette tapes&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sony pioneered the development of compact discs for music, and developed the Walkman CD for portable use&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sony gave us the Playstation, which went far beyond Nintendo in creating the products that excited users and made “home gaming” a market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hartung argues that a lack of product vision, and management by numbers has led to the company&amp;#8217;s downfall. Here he blames Japanese industrial culture, which focused on improving manufacturing processes and reducing costs, but led to little innovation elsewhere. Quite how Sony made all their technological breakthroughs (including &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling#History'&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that led to a &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Esaki'&gt;Nobel prize&lt;/a&gt;) if they were complicit in this &amp;#8220;neglect research, lower costs&amp;#8221; mentality, is left unexplained. In addition, Sony prided itself on selling quality goods at a premium. Sure, they pursued manufacturing and supply-chain improvements, much like Apple does today, but the savings only bolstered their already heaving margins. In this, they distinguished themselves from other Japanese companies of the era. They also ruthlessly dumped businesses with low margins, such as pocket calculators (a decision Morita bemoaned later in his autobiography, because it put Sony back when the age of computers began).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next he goes on to point out Sony&amp;#8217;s history of pushing proprietary formats: Betamax, ATRAC (which Hartung calls Sony MP3, for some reason), and most recently, Blu-ray. He fails to mention the CD-ROM standard, on which Sony collaborated with Philips. He also forgets that once Betamax died, Sony happily got behind VHS and sold VCRs for many years, even winning the landmark &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_shifting'&gt;time-shifting&lt;/a&gt; judgement from the US Supreme Court. So even losing a format war in the past didn&amp;#8217;t hinder the selling of products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, ex-CEO Howard Stringer gets it in the neck for cutting costs and laying off people. It may be true that Stringer might not have been what the company needed culturally or from a &amp;#8220;big picture&amp;#8221; standpoint. But the Sony he took over had become an unwieldy, unfocused giant with too many businesses and units (what the hell were they doing selling insurance and renting helicopters?). It could be argued that the company needed a dose of discipline (not at the expense of innovation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the real reason Sony is struggling is that they never &amp;#8220;got&amp;#8221; the age of computers. They remained stuck in their ways of producing pretty-looking gadgets that were as sleek and small as possible (sound familiar?), without realizing that these gadgets could now be full-featured computers, with software on them. For that matter, I don&amp;#8217;t think they&amp;#8217;ve ever really understood software or the Internet. These things came after the company&amp;#8217;s initial successes, and not many of the early employees studied at American universities, or worked at American corporations that were performing research on the Internet, Unix and C. I don&amp;#8217;t think Sony ever saw themselves as a pure consumer electronics company either, seemingly attempting to model themselves on the likes of GE (especially when you look at their disparate businesses), RCA or other Japanese conglomerates. Having missed the information age boat once, they then proceeded to do so again, with the mobile age, choosing to partner with Ericsson and giving the whole setup some stepmotherly treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having fallen behind technologically in a very important area (software), they also neglected one of their core strengths: industrial design. The Walkman, the Trinitron TV or the first &amp;#8220;pocketable&amp;#8221; transistor radio were stunning achievements of industrial design in consumer electronics. Why don&amp;#8217;t we see that anymore from Sony? It could be, as Hartung claims, because of cost-cutting, but it could also be because they no longer have a product-focused CEO like Morita, or his successor Norio Ohga. In this at least, Hartung is correct.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Dan Frommer decided to write a story about what everyone else knows; Google is scared of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t news to anybody really. Therefore, quite why he felt the need to write a story titled &lt;a href='http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_facebook_terrifies_google.php'&gt;Why Facebook Terrifies Google&lt;/a&gt; is beyond this blog. Because it&amp;#8217;s really quite simple: people spend more time on Facebook, Facebook knows more about those people, Facebook can serve better ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure it&amp;#8217;s nice to include a few screenshots from FB&amp;#8217;s ad creation interface, to demonstrate what kind of targeting can be done. But if the bar for what is &amp;#8220;news&amp;#8221; has been lowered to this level, expect a piece on how SourceForge is changing the world of open-source softwa&amp;#8230;oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='what_does_anecdotal_mean'&gt;What does Anecdotal Mean?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sparkling journalism from the one-Pulitzer-a-year New York Times, as they reported that growing numbers of children of immigrants to the US are moving back to their parents&amp;#8217; homelands in search of opportunity. People in India know this of course, thanks to Shahrukh Khan in &lt;em&gt;Swades&lt;/em&gt;. But surely Mr. Khan was an exception; not many have a Gayatri Joshi waiting for them. What kind of numbers are we talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/us/more-us-children-of-immigrants-are-leaving-us.html?pagewanted=all'&gt;Many U.S. Immigrants’ Children Seek American Dream Abroad&lt;/a&gt;, Kirk Semple promises much, quoting an expert as saying &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve gone beyond anecdotal evidence.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of pieces of anecdotal evidence in the article: 6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of pieces of statistical evidence: 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(and that, a figure about the number of people of Indian descent that arrived in India in 2010, without regard to length of stay, purpose of visit, and with no context of past numbers given)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For shame.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='dont_feel_like_writing_produce_reality_tv'&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Feel like Writing? Produce Reality TV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gawker&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href='http://gawker.com/5901613'&gt;Ryan Tate&lt;/a&gt; dug into &lt;a href='http://pandodaily.com/2012/04/05/an-open-letter-to-randi-zuckerberg-how-could-you-do-this-to-real-entrepreneurs/'&gt;Sarah Lacey&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of Silicon Valley, saying what the rest of us know already; they&amp;#8217;re dying to become famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving out the irony of a website that unflinchingly employs provocative titles to drive page views to basically tame pieces of fluff accusing someone else of attention-seeking behaviour, there is a kernel of truth in this. Lacey&amp;#8217;s attack on Randi Zuckerberg&amp;#8217;s upcoming reality TV show was pointless for a number of reasons. Just because she worked at Facebook and her brother built it, doesn&amp;#8217;t make she&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;selling out&amp;#8221; Silicon Valley. Who cares how tech companies are depicted on TV? Does it really matter if companies in the Valley are shown partying and taking off their shirts all the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Gawker being Gawker, they had to be &amp;#8220;reliably informed&amp;#8221; that Lacey tried and failed to create her own tech reality TV show. The obvious conclusion to be drawn (if you work at Gawker), is that anyone who attacks Zuckerberg&amp;#8217;s show really just wants the fame for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog thinks they should all shut up and get back to work. And let Zuckerberg do her job.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='you_done_goofed_i_backtraced_it'&gt;You done goofed! I backtraced it!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counter-terrorism expert and writer Richard A. Clarke served up some wonderful BS today. In an &lt;a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/opinion/how-china-steals-our-secrets.html'&gt;Op-Ed&lt;/a&gt; piece for the New York Times, he held forth on the number of trade secrets and technology American companies are losing to hackers. Quoting Gen. Keith B Alexander, he calls it &amp;#8220;the greatest transfer of wealth in history&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where he starts sounding less like an &amp;#8220;expert&amp;#8221; and more like the &amp;#8220;Consequences Will Never Be the Same&amp;#8221; dad. What he suggests is patent nonsense: &amp;#8220;the United States government could stop files in the process of being stolen from getting to the Chinese hackers&amp;#8221;, by having the DHS scan every file coming in and going out, a la a cyber customs force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, if it was that simple, piracy wouldn&amp;#8217;t exist. If ordinary people can get &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; for free from foreign websites, it&amp;#8217;s reasonable to assume skilled Chinese uber-hackers could do the reverse without much trouble, no matter who&amp;#8217;s watching the pipes. Then there&amp;#8217;s also the issue of the DHS having to install filters on every line in and out, maintain a database of &amp;#8220;sensitive files&amp;#8221; which they would have to amass from companies, who need to be comfortable putting proprietary information into the hands of a government body that&amp;#8217;s no more likely to be secure than the companies themselves. The whole idea of a government cyber border patrol manning a nation&amp;#8217;s digital frontiers is laughable; an idea from the original &lt;i&gt;Tron&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;VR Troopers&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t a single idea in this whole enterprise that doesn&amp;#8217;t have a faint touch of the ridiculous. From gems like: &amp;#8220;If government agencies were authorized to create a major program to grab stolen data leaving the country, they could drastically reduce today’s wholesale theft of American corporate secrets&amp;#8221;, to the only flaw in the plan being &amp;#8220;privacy advocates&amp;#8221;. The only person who stands to benefit from any such legislation is Richard A Clarke himself. An expert like him could stand to mint a small fortune from consulting engagements, if such legislation or executive orders were considered. It seems about par for a man who has Amazon affiliate links to his own book on his own &lt;a href='http://www.richardaclarke.net/'&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; (seriously, who does that?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Mr. Clarke unwittingly offers a much simpler solution himself. He notes that the SEC recommends companies to disclose breaches in security. Perhaps it should be made mandatory. The only ways to get CEOs to pay attention to regulatory issues are the threat of jail time, or a drop in the stock price. Repeated breaches, when revealed by force of SEC regulation, will do plenty to ensure the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The World of DIY Drones</title>
   <link href="http://jayraj.net/links/2012/03/24/WIRT"/>
   <updated>2012-03-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>hhttp://jayraj.net/links/2012/03/24/WIRT</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='these_aint_your_older_siblings_drones'&gt;These Ain&amp;#8217;t Your Older Sibling&amp;#8217;s Drones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I took my first steps into the world of DIY drones. Saw a link on a colleague&amp;#8217;s GChat status (thanks Andrew!) - &lt;a href='http://tacocopter.com'&gt;tacocopter.com&lt;/a&gt;. I still don&amp;#8217;t know if they&amp;#8217;re for real, but this West coast startup purports to deliver tacos using flying robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dove headlong into the world of DIY drones to find out if it was possible. Turns out, information is really sparse on the ground (weak laugh). &lt;a href='https://code.google.com/p/arducopter/'&gt;Arducopter&lt;/a&gt; is a hotbed of activity; an open-source UAV autopilot project. This thing is ridiculously futuristic-sounding: &amp;#8220;scripted waypoints, GPS, sonar sensor for automated takeoff and landing capability&amp;#8221;. And it starts at $600!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a theoretical range of 4km in some configurations, and minimum payload capabilities of 500gm (although these two figures were obtained separately, so I don&amp;#8217;t know if both are possible), food delivery using drones is tantalizingly within reach of the existing technology. It just needs a determined startup to max out these capabilities, solve the security problems, set up charging stations (maybe on cellphone towers?) and provide food delivery as a service (FDaS?) to restaurants. So restaurants can focus on doing what they do best: making the food. The drone flies in, picks up the food, drops it off and zips back to its charging station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, using an entire car and person to deliver a single parcel of food is rather wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory issues will undoubtedly crop up. The FAA will get involved. And of course, the potential for lawsuits when a drone inevitably falls out of the sky and conks somebody in head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: What you inevitably get for posting too early: &lt;a href='https://code.google.com/p/arducopter/'&gt;Tacocopter is a fake service&lt;/a&gt; and the article confirms my suspicions that the regulatory and safety issues make this nearly impossible in the near future. Shame.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>How to Solve a Quality Problem</title>
   <link href="http://jayraj.net/links/2012/03/06/WIRT"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='amateur_hour_is_clearly_better_than_the_pros'&gt;Amateur Hour is Clearly Better than the Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logical reasoning is an overrated skill for Wired magazine. Mike Isaac&amp;#8217;s story &lt;a href='http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/03/mit-google-release-new-tools-to-fix-androids-quality-control-problem'&gt;MIT, Google Release New Tools to Fix Android’s Quality-Control Problem&lt;/a&gt; is an example of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the reasonable premise that Android apps don&amp;#8217;t look as good as iOS ones, Isaac first stretches the meaning of the word &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; while describing Android App Inventor, considering Google originally released it well over a year ago. The only difference now is that MIT Media Lab has taken over the project because Google couldn&amp;#8217;t be bothered to do it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, is the absurd conclusion drawn that making Android app making accessible to more people will improve the quality of apps produced. NPD&amp;#8217;s Ben Arnold is even quoted as saying &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s kind of what Tumblr or Blogger has done for web development.&amp;#8221; That pretty much sums it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fairness, Isaac does also mention the new Android Design guidelines website, something which will probably do a great deal more to advance the cause of Android app design.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Read this piece in Engadget today about a $25 desktop computer system named the &lt;a href='http://www.raspberrypi.org/'&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I can say is &amp;#8220;How cute!&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a little circuit board that you can plug a monitor, keyboard and mouse into. It uses an SD card for storage and micro-USB cellphone charger for power. It&amp;#8217;s the geek&amp;#8217;s equivalent of seeing a puppy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Research Reveals Billfold is "Vulnerable"</title>
   <link href="http://jayraj.net/links/2012/02/11/WIRT"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='billfold_susceptible_even_without_rooting'&gt;Billfold Susceptible even Without &amp;#8220;Rooting&amp;#8221;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More accurately, it&amp;#8217;s the past couple of days as technology blogs have been quick to pounce on the fact that &lt;a href='https://zvelo.com/blog/entry/google-wallet-security-pin-exposure-vulnerability'&gt;Google Wallet is hackable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most alarmist &amp;#8220;research&amp;#8221; done these days, it comes with a caveat: the phone needs to be rooted. Or failing that &lt;a href='http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/9/2787758/second-google-wallet-security-vulnerability-confirmed-affects-all'&gt;stolen phones could have pre-paid credit stolen&lt;/a&gt; if the thief reinstalls the Wallet app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, in a &lt;a href='http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2012/02/protecting-your-payments-with-google.html'&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; today, made the quite reasonable argument that manufacturers disable root access to phones for precisely reasons like this. Any user that voluntarily roots their phone should know what they are getting into. And unlike a real wallet, you can put a security code on a cell phone to prevent someone from using it even if they steal it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically what tech blogs are saying is: &amp;#8220;Even though I&amp;#8217;ll definitely lose all my cash, credit cards and ID if my physical wallet is stolen, Google Wallet is the one that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;vulnerable&amp;#8217;&amp;#8220;. Gotta drive those pageviews people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I don&amp;#8217;t think mobile payments are such a swell idea right now, or even in the near future. Having a single point of failure makes me uncomfortable. If my battery dies or my phone is stolen, or dropped into a toilet bowl, or eaten by a bear, not only can I not call for help, I can&amp;#8217;t even pay for a cab to get me home.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>It's Only Chutzpah when Google Does It</title>
   <link href="http://jayraj.net/links/2012/02/09/WIRT"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='google_and_harvey_dent'&gt;Google and Harvey Dent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fair amount of heat in the press about Google applying the squeeze on Apple through Motorola&amp;#8217;s patent horde. Noted Apple (Designed in California&amp;#8482;) fanboy &lt;a href='http://pandodaily.com/2012/02/08/harvey-harvey-harvey-dent/'&gt;MG Siegler&lt;/a&gt; accused Google of being Two-Face from Batman because of this new strategy, because a year ago their public policy stance was that software patents are harmful and should not exist. And now they&amp;#8217;re demanding 2.25% of every iPhone and iPad sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, according to Siegler, companies shouldn&amp;#8217;t be allowed to change their minds, ever, even when the other side isn&amp;#8217;t playing by the same rules. If you declare yourself to be a pacifist, you should stand idly and let thugs beat you senseless. At least he admits that Apple is doing the same thing to Samsung and other Android OEMs, that being Steve Jobs&amp;#8217; wish. They&amp;#8217;re not even offering to license their patents and want their competitors to be shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Forbes magazine&amp;#8217;s editor &lt;a href='http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/02/09/chutzpah-google-also-wants-2-25-of-every-iphone-sale/'&gt;Philip Elmer-Dewitt&lt;/a&gt; thinks it&amp;#8217;s fair for Apple to assert their patents to shut down competition because those are proprietary works that the Cupertino giant never agreed to make industry standard, unlike Motorola&amp;#8217;s fundamental patents, which Moto promised to never assert when they were granted. Again, we see the opinion from a respected voice that companies should not be allowed to change their minds, even when the competition is playing by different rules&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola agreed to license their patents. Google will continue to do so, but will change the price. It&amp;#8217;s no more or less fair than suing someone over pinch-to-zoom interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='deleted_doesnt_really_mean_deleted_well_duh'&gt;&amp;#8220;Deleted&amp;#8221; Doesn&amp;#8217;t Really Mean Deleted? Well, duh.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/07/the-austrian-thorn-in-facebooks-side/'&gt;Forbes.com&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; Kashmir Hill shone the spotlight on one Max Schrems, a 24-year-old Austrian law student and privacy activist. When he takes a break from dancing to polka tunes, drinking coffee with chocolate, eating wiener schnitzels, and telling his Facebook friends that he did these things, Schrems cracks open his massive tomes on European privacy law to find new ways to harass Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all began very simply for young Max when he studied at Santa Clara University for a semester and learned that Facebook&amp;#8217;s lawyers knew precisely f*ck-all about privacy law in Europe. He also found an obscure page on Facebook where European users can get every bit of info that Facebook has about them, as per the law on the Continent. Upon submitting a copy of his passport, driver&amp;#8217;s license, birth certificate, scuba certification and even a hairdresser&amp;#8217;s license that they made him get for this express purpose, Schrems received a thousand (1000) page file with all his information. He said it was like the Stasi&amp;#8217;s files, because of the detail and scope of the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What vexed our young crusader the most is that some pieces of info had been tagged as &amp;#8221;&lt;span&gt;DELETED&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; but Facebook clearly still had them. He feels this is an outrage. Max, I don&amp;#8217;t know if you know how the Internet works, but Facebook provides this wonderful service, that costs a lot to operate, for free. In return for this, they will log every single thing you do on their platform, and keep it for all eternity. Call it the new social contract for the Internet. If you don&amp;#8217;t like it, don&amp;#8217;t do anything you don&amp;#8217;t want others to know on Facebook. Or just stop using Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='google_to_pay_you_for_your_information'&gt;Google to Pay You for Your Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s about damn time too. Google&amp;#8217;s new &lt;a href='http://www.google.com/landing/screenwisepanel/'&gt;Screenwise&lt;/a&gt; program offers Amazon gift certificates in return for letting Google watch your every move through their Chrome browser. I guess it&amp;#8217;s cool for those who are OK with it and really want the gift certificates. Though one does wonder if there&amp;#8217;s a minimum usage requirement. I mean, what if I sign up, but only use Firefox to browse the Web?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>TIL - Facebook tells Lies</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='its_all_semantics_really'&gt;It&amp;#8217;s All Semantics Really&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/those-millions-on-facebook-some-may-not-actually-visit/'&gt;Andrew Ross Sorkin&lt;/a&gt; was freaking out over Facebook&amp;#8217;s claims that it has 483 million active users everyday, implying it was disingenuous. The reason: Facebook counts &amp;#8220;Like&amp;#8221;-ing or sharing via the &amp;#8220;Share on Facebook&amp;#8221; button as being active on Facebook. Since these people don&amp;#8217;t see any ads, they don&amp;#8217;t make revenue directly for FB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, am I really more active if I login to Facebook and paste a link into my status update (theoretically, since I don&amp;#8217;t have an account), than if I click on the Share button from the article directly? Sorkin concedes that even non-FB domain engagement is valuable information to FB but insists that investors deserve to also have signed-in user numbers. IMHO, it&amp;#8217;s really not that big of a deal, except to stock analysts who want to seem like they&amp;#8217;re doing more work by examining another metric. It&amp;#8217;s entirely possible for Facebook to roll out an AdSense-style advertising network, making it irrelevant whether users actually visit Facebook.com. Speaking of which, how come Facebook doesn&amp;#8217;t have something like AdSense? Or is it just my small minded-ness to think AdSense is still relevant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='could_this_mean_free_porn_forever'&gt;Could this mean free porn forever?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A California woman&amp;#8217;s fight against the copyright mafia shakedown has brought to light an interesting legal question: can porn be copyrighted at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit the headline, &lt;a href='http://torrentfreak.com/you-cant-copyright-porn-bittorrent-defendant-insists-120206/'&gt;You Can&amp;#8217;t Copyright Porn, Harassed BitTorrent Defendant Insists&lt;/a&gt;, had me thinking of those people who upload Taylor Swift songs to Youtube and write &amp;#8220;No copyrights intented&lt;span&gt;sic&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;. Instead, Liuxia Wong of California, who was told that a copyright infringement lawsuit for allegedly pirating Hard Drive productions&amp;#8217; cinematic masterpiece &lt;em&gt;Amateur Allure Jen&lt;/em&gt; could go away for $3400, fought back with a stunning claim: porn can&amp;#8217;t be copyrighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright was intended &amp;#8220;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&amp;#8221;, and a California circuit court ruled that &amp;#8220;obscene works did not promote the progress of science and art&amp;#8221; (would love to see a link to this judgement somewhere, but the article did not say). If you put 2 and 2 together, this seems to imply that porn can&amp;#8217;t be copyrighted. Now it&amp;#8217;s unlikely that such a judgement will ever come to pass, so I think the most likely outcome is Hard Drive productions slinking away, tail between legs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='startups__conspiracy_or_extended_hackathon'&gt;Startups - Conspiracy or Extended Hackathon?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard-hitting stuff from &lt;a href='http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2012/02/the_dirty_littl_1.php'&gt;Tom Forenski and Silicon Valley Watcher&lt;/a&gt; as they expose the current startup mania (which this writer is a part of), as nothing more than an elaborate front for recruiting tech talent and making their investors rich, writing: &amp;#8220;Just one $25 million payday from the sale of a startup will more than cover an Angel investor&amp;#8217;s loss from a hundred dud $25K investments&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He does close on a heartwarming, cheer-the-underdog note by adding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley&amp;#8217;s dirty little secret is that the startup boom is mostly a disguised jobs fair that directly benefits the big corporations. &amp;gt; Occasionally, an innovative startup makes it past this stage but it has to be so bad that no one wants it &amp;#8211; not even for its team. It&amp;#8217;s &amp;gt; from among those ugly ducklings that the swans of the new age emerge: FB, Goog, Twitter, Yahoo! and others &amp;#8211; no one wanted them at first, &amp;gt; then they couldn&amp;#8217;t get enough of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last bit is slightly disingenuous. None of the companies mentioned above were shunned because of a lack of engineering talent; instead it was their (apparent) lack of a revenue model that made investors wary. Good job otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='lolwut_story_of_the_day'&gt;Lolwut? Story of the Day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-03/facebook-punters-put-shares-at-35-with-bono-ringing-bell.html'&gt;Reports&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook&amp;#8217;s IPO price being the subject of bets by leading UK bookmaker Paddy Power sounds odd on the face of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would someone bet on the price of a security at a bookmaker&amp;#8217;s when they can just do it in the real market? Granted, it&amp;#8217;s a bet on the issue price, which is the one price set, not by the open market, but by what Facebook&amp;#8217;s bankers think will move the most paper. But it still seems slightly backward and redundant to place bets on stock prices with a bookie, when you can do the same with a broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='pirates_are_romantic_figures'&gt;Pirates ARE Romantic Figures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120126/09565417551/why-piracy-is-indispensable-survival-our-culture.shtml'&gt;Quick line about this article&lt;/a&gt; from pirate-sympathizers Techdirt, who argue that DRM will logically result in a loss of our digital heritage as archivists are unable to preserve the past. History will thank the pirates for doing their thing. Fight the man. We shall overcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Clearly most of the tech world is focused elsewhere, but I thought this was the more interesting piece of news. Once the dominant force in consumer electronics, maker of shiny silver gadgets that people coveted and carried in their pockets, Sony &lt;a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/back-to-basics-sony-appoints-kazuo-hirai-ousts-stringer/'&gt;fired its British CEO Sir Howard Stringer&lt;/a&gt;, elevating their electronics division head Kazuo Hirai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past 10-15 years have not been kind to the once-great company. They never &amp;#8220;got&amp;#8221; the Internet or the mobile revolution, and are suffering for it. TC recommends that Sony head back to the safety of its Playstation platform and dominate games, but that&amp;#8217;s no way for a company like them to go. Microsoft and its Xbox division have scads of cash and traction, and console gaming isn&amp;#8217;t growing like it once used to. It would be sad to see them try to make a go of it in mobile or social gaming. No, there&amp;#8217;s only one way forward for them, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony was known for its stunning, clean designs, elegant gadgets and ability to push the boundaries of what was possible with electronics (they created the first pocketable radio, the first portable music player and many other firsts). They must try to get back to those roots. Software isn&amp;#8217;t their strength, and it&amp;#8217;s fortuitous that HP recently decided to open-source WebOS, a lost little orphan looking for a loving home. Sony have the cash to throw at making it a viable platform and the pure engineering ability to design and build devices of outstanding quality. Let&amp;#8217;s hope they haven&amp;#8217;t lost their stomach for the fight; it&amp;#8217;s all-too-easy for Apple (Designed in California &amp;#8482;) at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='facebook_ipo_follows_formula'&gt;Facebook IPO Follows Formula&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the trail blazed by tech companies in recent years, Facebook (dubbed the IPO of the century) finally filed to go public today. The filing displayed all the tropes of a tech company&amp;#8217;s filing: letter from founder setting out idealistic vision - check, CEO taking a $1 salary but becoming filthy rich - check, promises to maintain a certain unique company culture - check, appeals to investors to take into account that it&amp;#8217;s more than just a company or an investment - check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FB is a mammoth, of that there is no doubt. They have large profits and equally impressive margins ($1 billion and 27%, respectively, last year). Apart from letting investors and early employees cash out and get rich, they don&amp;#8217;t really need to IPO, with numbers like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not providing links for this because it&amp;#8217;s easily the biggest tech news story since Steve Jobs&amp;#8217; death.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>You Lost Files? Boo-f\*ckin-hoo</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='feds_will_soon_approve_shooting_through_hostages'&gt;Feds will Soon Approve Shooting Through Hostages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the continuing fallout from the Megaupload takedown, the feds have essentially told users: &amp;#8220;We don&amp;#8217;t care about your treasured memories and important work documents&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Megaupload is unable to pay its hosting bills due to their assets being frozen, &lt;a href='http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/feds_to_megaupload_users_tough_luck.php'&gt;ReadWriteWeb reported today&lt;/a&gt;. Because of payment defaults, their hosting company may soon start deleting data. And since the government wasn&amp;#8217;t given search warrants for Megaupload&amp;#8217;s users&amp;#8217; files, they can&amp;#8217;t back them up either. The bottomline: if someone doesn&amp;#8217;t change their minds soon, people are going to lose stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blaming users for storing their files on Megaupload is like blaming injured innocent bystanders in a shootout between cops and drug dealers: &amp;#8220;Well obviously, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t have been walking through such a dangerous neighbourhood.&amp;#8221; To those who say it&amp;#8217;s not right to compare a computer user losing files to a 13-year old getting shot on the way to school, I would say that it&amp;#8217;s also not right to compare drug dealing with someone illicitly downloading the odd movie or song. If society has decided that it&amp;#8217;s not right to put innocent lives at risk when pursuing suspects of heinous crimes, then it follows that it&amp;#8217;s not right to put innocent files at risk when pursuing suspects of copyright crimes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='code_language_for_we_dont_like_your_kind_round_here'&gt;Code Language for &amp;#8220;We don&amp;#8217;t like your kind &amp;#8216;round here&amp;#8221;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/us/bay-area-technology-professionals-cant-get-hired-as-industry-moves-on.html'&gt;NY Times article&lt;/a&gt; today reported the travails of older technology workers in Silicon Valley who find work hard to come by. Despite most half-decent 20 year-old coders having job offers coming out of their ears and noses, older workers are discriminated against by Web companies because many don&amp;#8217;t have the skills needed today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jury is out on whether older people are less adept at coding and adapting than young &amp;#8216;uns. Cynics will say that companies prefer healthy 20-somethings (lower health insurance costs) with no social lives and lower salary expectations, and who grew up texting in Ruby on Rails (or something). Proponents of the older crowd note that programming, like most disciplines, is about pattern recognition and more experience means longer and more varied exposure to patterns, which means older coders are more productive. But that&amp;#8217;s not what we&amp;#8217;re talking about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HR uses phrases like: &amp;#8220;Are they going to get to do what they love to do for fun at work?&amp;#8221;, that people say are code-words for discrimination (of course no 40 year-old is going to get excited about Node.js; they think it&amp;#8217;s asinine to use a language like Javascript, on a barely 2-year old platform). LinkedIn wants employees to be &amp;#8220;entrepreneurial&amp;#8221;; which is a bit like a zoo director saying he wants his tigers to be &amp;#8220;vegetarian&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s easy to see what job doesn&amp;#8217;t need you to be familiar with a dictionary, as long as you sound impressive.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;blockquote class='twitter-tweet tw-align-center'&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re not you when you’re hungry @&lt;a href='https://twitter.com/snickersUk'&gt;snickersUk&lt;/a&gt;#hungry#spon   &lt;a title='http://lockerz.com/s/177408824' href='http://t.co/PUZnINcl'&gt;lockerz.com/s/177408824&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rio Ferdinand (@rioferdy5) &lt;a data-datetime='2012-01-24T15:57:51+00:00' href='https://twitter.com/rioferdy5/status/161840144628973568'&gt;January 24, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rio Ferdinand of Manchester United (sigh) was responsible for a storm in a tempest (shield your eyes if you expect cliches used correctly) today when he promoted a Snickers bar on his Twitter feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Sawers at &lt;a href='http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/01/28/brands-may-be-paying-celebrities-for-tweets-but-whos-paying-twitter/'&gt;The Next Web&lt;/a&gt; wrote that the UK authorities might have a problem with any implied (ie, not explicit) endorsement as being unfair. It&amp;#8217;s safe to say that won&amp;#8217;t happen (as many commenters on the post pointed out), because of the #spon hashtag, coupled with the fact that it was so out of the ordinary for Rio (sample tweet: &amp;#8220;Morning tweeps! Back from training! Wazza in my #pocket. #stayonyourfeet #piershasmoobs&amp;#8221;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless Rio was doing this for charity, it&amp;#8217;s also worth wondering how much Snickers paid him to piss off his 2 million followers. And pissed off they were. It must be a lot, because he&amp;#8217;s one of the highest paid players in the Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='fight_fight_fight'&gt;Fight! Fight! Fight!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YC-backed Curebit were caught red-handed being very naughty. The firm&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/#!/allangrant'&gt;Allan Grant&lt;/a&gt; was embroiled in a pitched Twitter battle with RoR creator &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/#!/dhh'&gt;David Heinemeier Hansson&lt;/a&gt; (whose middle name is the answer to the question: &amp;#8220;What should I do if I get 4 Es and 2 Is in Scrabble?&amp;#8221;) about copied HTML code, design and even (shamefully) hot-linked images from one of Hansson&amp;#8217;s 37Signals sites (or something like that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant started off defensive (&amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re a small company&amp;#8221;), then quickly discovered that the leg he thought he had to stand on (he&amp;#8217;d hot-linked to this leg too) did not exist (it started 404-ing). With the tide of popular Intertweets opinion turning against him, he quickly capitulated (or at least, pretended to). For me, this has ended in disappointing fashion. Hansson is a racecar driver and who wouldn&amp;#8217;t have paid to see the two of them race down the Golden Gate Bridge to settle this? (give me a break, I don&amp;#8217;t know jack about SFO&amp;#8217;s geography).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>$167/year raises are newsworthy</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='new_employee_discount_program_at_apple'&gt;New Employee Discount Program at Apple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Splendid stretching of the definition of &amp;#8220;news&amp;#8221; by &lt;a href='http://9to5mac.com/2012/01/25/tim-cook-at-todays-town-hall-starting-in-june-apple-employees-get-500-off-macs-250-off-ipads/'&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/a&gt;. Apple (Designed in California&amp;#8482;) CEO Tim Cook announced a new employee benefit at the company&amp;#8217;s internal town hall yesterday. Starting June, all employees will get $500 off (in addition to their existing 25% discount on all company products) on Macs and iPads. The catch: they can only use it once every 3 years. This works out to about $167/year/employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;#8217;re on the topic of employee benefits, the gold standard must surely be Google, who announced a &lt;a href='http://articles.businessinsider.com/2010-11-09/tech/30024423_1_google-ceo-googlers-eric-schmidt'&gt;$1000 (post-tax) Christmas bonus and an across-the-board 10% salary hike&lt;/a&gt; 2 years ago. Compared to that, the most valuable company in the world giving out $167 in store credit is a bit laughable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='att_try_to_be_more_tonedeaf_than_mpaa'&gt;AT&amp;amp;T Try to be More Tone-Deaf than MPAA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T CEO Randall Stevenson is doing his best to cement his company&amp;#8217;s position at the &lt;a href='http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2011/12/survey-at38t-rates-last-in-customer-satisfaction/1'&gt;bottom of the customer satisfaction rankings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still peeved at the breakdown of the T-Mobile acquisition thanks to the FCC, Stevenson announced that AT&amp;amp;T would have to increase data prices because of a lack of capacity, because they weren&amp;#8217;t allowed to acquire T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a capacity-constrained environment we will manage usage-based data plans, increased pricing and managing the speeds of the highest volume users. These are all logical and necessary steps to manage utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has already been pointed out though, AT&amp;amp;T has actually reduced their per-unit price for data on all plans. The only effect of the &amp;#8220;price increase&amp;#8221; has been to force customers onto more expensive plans, even though they pay less per unit of data on these plans. Clearly capacity isn&amp;#8217;t a problem at AT&amp;amp;T if they can afford to give out more for less. Instead as &lt;a href='http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/att_ceo_randall_stevenson_blasts_fcc_hints_at_high.php'&gt;ReadWriteWeb&lt;/a&gt; points out, this is more of a punishment to their customers and the FCC. Or a tantrum. However you want to look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog suggests that AT&amp;amp;T take some of that $40 billion they were planning to spend on buying T-Mobile and put some more cell towers up. Maybe give out some &lt;a href='http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20001242-264.html'&gt;femtocells for free&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Everyone should be above average</title>
   <link href="http://jayraj.net/links/2012/01/25/WIRT"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='friedman_wades_into_the_jobs_vs_tech_debate'&gt;Friedman wades into the jobs vs tech debate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Friedman of the New York Times displayed a masterclass today in phoning it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his column titled &lt;a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/opinion/friedman-average-is-over.html'&gt;Average is Over&lt;/a&gt;, he first explained that technology has been eating away at many jobs (like it has done for the past 100 years) and that this has gotten even faster in the last 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he trots out this revolutionary idea that anyone of average talent and skill is doomed to dim professional prospects. Now there&amp;#8217;s some sound career advice kids. And it&amp;#8217;s not like &lt;a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/if-youre-an-average-worker-in-this-forever-recession-youre-going-straight-to-the-bottom-2012-1'&gt;Business Insider reported Seth Godin saying the exact same thing&lt;/a&gt; a week ago. Wait&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as a commenter on the column points out, it&amp;#8217;s mathematically impossible for EVERYONE to be above average. That means that a significant portion of the population are going to be stuck in menial jobs forever. In fairness to Friedman, he may have meant &amp;#8220;above average&amp;#8221; when considering the entire world&amp;#8217;s population. Getting a degree in English from the Southern Arkansas University (no offense) may not make you above average in the US (or even Arkansas), but still puts you pretty high up the chain when considering the entire world&amp;#8217;s workforce. Now if only graduates of the Southern Arkansas University could move to China&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='apple_makes_a_fckload_of_money'&gt;Apple Makes a F&lt;em&gt;ckload of Money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noted blogger, venture capitalist and Apple (Designed in California&amp;#8482;) fanboy MG Siegler called Apple&amp;#8217;s first quarter 2012 results &lt;a href='http://parislemon.com/post/16424622119/a-holy-fucking-shit-quarter'&gt;&amp;#8220;A &amp;#8216;Holy Fucking Shit&amp;#8217; Quarter&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;. The numbers are impressive indeed; $13 billion profits on $46 billion sales. Or in other words, more money than God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They now have close to a $100 billion in the bank. It might not be a bad idea for the EU to ask them for a bailout. Or help other poor people. C&amp;#8217;mon people. You can re-open the charity department again. And give someone else a chance to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='i_for_one_welcome_our_new_robot_drivers'&gt;I, for one, welcome our new robot drivers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href='http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/01/ff_autonomouscars/all/1'&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/technology/googles-autonomous-vehicles-draw-skepticism-at-legal-symposium.html'&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href='http://www.thestar.com/article/1120427--bmw-creates-robot-car-that-can-drive-itself'&gt;press&lt;/a&gt; recently has made it clear that autonomous cars are just around the corner. The NYT covered a symposium dedicated to the legal implications of this new technology. The benefits are clear: safety, fuel and time efficiency, greater car-sharing and privacy for sexy times in the backseat without having to rent a limo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s safe to say that this technology is at least 6 years away from even narrow-spread adoption. Nevada is the only state, so far, to legalize autonomously driven cars. Other state legislatures will begin to consider the issue over the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that all the other issues: insurance, police stops, deer on the road and even the Chinese restaurant/stop sign problem (I don&amp;#8217;t know if they&amp;#8217;re the same thing, but have superficial similarities in that sharing access to a resource leads to a starvation condition and indefinite waiting), will work themselves out eventually. What I&amp;#8217;m curious about is the process used to certify or give a &amp;#8220;driver&amp;#8217;s license&amp;#8221; to these programs. Will they be held to the same standards that human beings are? Is it really possible to verify that a driving program has no bugs and will perform perfectly under all conditions? Or will it just be &amp;#8220;good enough&amp;#8221; if the program is better than the &amp;#8220;average driver&amp;#8221;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we get into thorny territory. Google have claimed that their car has driven 200,000 miles without accidents, but that&amp;#8217;s not really statistically significant (unless they have more data they haven&amp;#8217;t released yet). In &lt;a href='http://www.motorists.org/other/crash-data'&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt; (yes, I know, old as hell, but I&amp;#8217;m lazy), the US had 1.5 fatal accidents per 100 million vehicle miles. If anyone wants to do more detailed analysis, they are welcome to, but 200k is hardly conclusive that the program is safe. Unless&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More speculation here: I&amp;#8217;m no computer vision expert; is it possible to train such a system on video data? If it is, then Google must have a wealth of such data, thanks to StreetView. And in that case, the system may only have driven 200,000 real world miles but tested on many many more.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>RIM's new Dear Leader...</title>
   <link href="http://jayraj.net/links/2012/01/22/WIRT"/>
   <updated>2012-01-22T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>hhttp://jayraj.net/links/2012/01/22/WIRT</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='rim_appoint_new_dear_leader'&gt;RIM appoint new Dear Leader&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the vastness of the frozen north, the Republic of Imaginary Millions&amp;#8217; (RIM) Politburo selected Thorsten Heins as their general secretary. Heins replaces Jim Balsille, one of the founding fathers of the Republic, and Mike Lazaridis. Like his predecessors, Heins, retains his firm belief in the nation&amp;#8217;s destiny, &lt;a href='http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/at-research-in-motion-a-new-ceo-vows-to-silence-the-doomsayers/article2310968/'&gt;declaring&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fantastic growth story and it’s not coming to an end. What you will see with me is rigour and flawless execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIM is a major exporter of fruit, primarily Blackberries. Unfortunately, the world&amp;#8217;s demand for Blackberries has slumped even as the market for fruit, especially Apples, has grown. The embattled nation has had to face defections, &lt;a href='http://www.bgr.com/2011/06/30/open-letter-to-blackberry-bosses-senior-rim-exec-tells-all-as-company-crumbles-around-him/'&gt;public shamings&lt;/a&gt; and the draining of its treasury. Although some developing nations, such as India, are still pursuing &lt;a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/01/09/leaked-memo-claims-phone-companies-let-india-spy-on-u-s-emails/'&gt;strategic security alliances&lt;/a&gt; with the Republic, and even buying their old hardware, most of the Western world regards the nation as a power in terminal decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether Mr. Heins (hereafter, known as Dear Leader), will be able to breathe life back into the Republic of Imaginary Millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='filesonic_running_for_cover'&gt;Filesonic Running for Cover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like ants from a broken anthill, file-sharing sites are scrambling to get out of the Justice Department and Big Content&amp;#8217;s giant cross-hairs. The two have declared war on every single website and service that offers file uploading and downloading, leaving the likes &lt;a href='http://torrentfreak.com/filesonic-kills-file-sharing-after-megaupload-arrests-120122/'&gt;Filesonic&lt;/a&gt; quivering in their boots. Filesonic has suspended file download capability, allowing users to only access their personal files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This explains why Today I Read couldn&amp;#8217;t download the latest installment of Dr. Do-me-a-little. For research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='joel_spolskys_sopasmart_idea'&gt;Joel Spolsky&amp;#8217;s SOPA-smart idea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StackOverflow and FogCreek Software founder, and software writer &lt;a href='https://plus.google.com/u/0/117114202722218150209/posts/4GgaRiSyaTf'&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt; offered possibly some of the best solutions to SOPA/PIPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, he proposed a counter-attack by lobbying to abolish software patents, introduce punitive legislation for patent trolls, enshrine linking to content in a law protecting free speech, and also called on Web companies who want to support pro-them candidates to offer free advertisement, so that they aren&amp;#8217;t so beholden to other people for campaign funding. In my opinion, that last one is just a different way of funding campaigns, and it&amp;#8217;s not difficult to see a future where Google would call a majority of the shots through Youtube. Or, in an ironic twist, the content providers might get the last laugh by employing Hulu for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, it&amp;#8217;s good to see that someone&amp;#8217;s looking for a positive reaction to the whole thing, instead of resigning the industry to fight the MPAA every couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='new_york_times_blames_apple_for_americas_manufacturing_woes'&gt;New York Times Blames Apple for America&amp;#8217;s Manufacturing Woes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maverick stuff from the &lt;a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all'&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; today, as they laid out a narrative of America falling from its industrial greatness due to the flight of high-tech manufacturing to Asia. And leading the exodus, according to this narrative, was the world&amp;#8217;s most valuable technology company Apple (Designed in California&amp;#8482;). They acknowledge that Apple kept production in the family till as recently as 2002, but efficiencies and labor shortages drove them to the Orient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Times painted a terrifying picture of thousands of Chinese workers roused from their dorms at midnight by shouting, grey-uniformed, jackbooted Germans to accommodate Herr Jobs&amp;#8217; newest demands. Many commenters described it as &amp;#8220;slave labor&amp;#8221; ignoring that the definition of slavery is involuntary servitude. IMO the term is appropriate for child prostitutes in Thailand or Cambodia, but over the top for workers at Foxconn; they are only slightly less fortunate than Wal-Mart workers in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also unfair to target Apple or even the computer electronics industry. It wasn&amp;#8217;t the first industry to do it. General Electric, that stalwart of American manufacturing and symbol of American ingenuity, started the obsession with &amp;#8220;shareholder value&amp;#8221; and began to offshore manufacturing in the late 70s and early 80s. For various reasons, the home appliances industry, machine tools, steel, shipbuilding and countless others began the march out of the US long before Americans had heard of the Internet. And even when there are opportunities for high-tech manufacturing in new industries, like solar power, the US has (cliches ahoy!) managed to shoot itself in the foot and hand the initiative to other countries. Yes, China has terrible labor protections, but that hasn&amp;#8217;t stopped Germany or Japan competing with them to be the shopfloor of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='mpaa_threatens_to_stop_paying_for_senators_private_jets_mistresses_and_ponies'&gt;MPAA Threatens to Stop Paying for Senators&amp;#8217; Private Jets, Mistresses and Ponies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who count on quote &amp;#8216;Hollywood&amp;#8217; for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who&amp;#8217;s going to stand up for them when their job is at stake. Don&amp;#8217;t ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don&amp;#8217;t pay any attention to me when my job is at stake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So spake former Senator, now MPAA mouthpiece, Chris Dodd. Threatening the vengeance of Thor, Iron-Man and the Punisher on all Congressmen who dared defy the MPAA&amp;#8217;s edicts to pass SOPA/PIPA into law, Dodd (curiously, in another life, co-sponsor of legislation that &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act#Overview'&gt;protected consumers from big bully banks&lt;/a&gt;) singlehandedly dragged the MPAA&amp;#8217;s previously squeaky clean name through mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only wish lobbyists in India were this explicit.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id='fallout_from_the_megaupload_takedown'&gt;Fallout from the Megaupload takedown&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Ars Technica, &lt;a title='Why the feds smashed Megaupload' href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/why-the-feds-smashed-megaupload.ars'&gt;Nate Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, does a great piece on analyzing the specific timing of the Megaupload crackdown, with his sources implying that it wasn&amp;#8217;t a coincidence that it happened a day after Congress&amp;#8217; SOPA/PIPA debacle. &lt;a title='Kim Dotcom' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Schmitz'&gt;Kim Dotcom&lt;/a&gt; is a great name, it has to be said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over at CNET &lt;a title='Anonymous Megaupload' href='http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-57362437-256/anonymous-goes-nuclear-everybody-loses/'&gt;Molly Wood&lt;/a&gt; criticized Anonymous&amp;#8217; actions in DDoS-ing the Justice Department, MPAA, RIAA, Boy Scouts of America and half a dozen nuns at a mission in Costa Rica. IMHO, no one except Justice Department, MPAA and RIAA employees, and reporters doing research, ever accesses those websites. Despite a scary looking screenshot from &lt;a title='Akamai Internet Monitor' href='http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/dataviz1.html,'&gt;Akamai&amp;#8217;s Internet monitor&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s evident that the US has actually had fewer attacks in the last 24 hours (not sure how Akamai defines an &amp;#8220;attack&amp;#8221;) than parts of the world that have had nothing to do with these events, to wit Brazil, Peru, China, Russia and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='googleappleadobe_poaching_antitrust_lawsuit'&gt;Google-Apple-Adobe Poaching Antitrust Lawsuit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title='Google Apple Poaching' href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/19/damning-evidence-emerges-in-google-apple-no-poach-antitrust-lawsuit/'&gt;Techcrunch&lt;/a&gt; reported that the Department of Justice found documentary evidence of &amp;#8220;no-poaching&amp;#8221; agreements between some of the Valley&amp;#8217;s highest-profile companies, among them Google, Apple, Adobe, Intuit, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies agreed not only to not steal each others&amp;#8217; employees but even notify an applicant&amp;#8217;s current employers, a move one would associate with the likes of Foxconn or Soviet Russia. Presumably, the offending employees are then sent off to gulags/iPhone-assembly factories with n-hexane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From lobbying to loosen immigration laws for skilled workers to &lt;a href='http://www.codecademy.com/'&gt;funding companies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-57358837-52/nyc-high-school-will-train-badly-needed-software-engineers/'&gt;even high schools&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to teaching people how to program computers, tech companies are pulling out all the stops to keep programmer costs down. I don&amp;#8217;t know much about AI but given the incentives and economics of the thing, you have to figure that somewhere along the line, someone will surely teach computers how to program themselves to a sufficiently high skill level. Hopefully, that won&amp;#8217;t happen in my lifetime, but the odds aren&amp;#8217;t good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='apples_foray_into_textbooks'&gt;Apple&amp;#8217;s Foray into Textbooks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/a-brief-history-of-textbooks-or-why-apples-new-textbook-experience-is-actually-revolutionary/251662/'&gt;Megan Garber&lt;/a&gt; in The Atlantic reckons that Apple&amp;#8217;s new approach to textbooks is revolutionary. The reason: textbooks become personal because students can write in them and keep them even after they&amp;#8217;re done with the course. While I agree that there&amp;#8217;s some value in getting to keep a textbook forever, the fact remains that once the student leaves school, she must buy an iDevice or read it on a computer screen from iTunes. There&amp;#8217;s no escaping Apple&amp;#8217;s walled garden. And in a world with Wikipedia, why would anyone restrict themselves to their history textbook as their sole source of information on the Mexican-American war?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the author&amp;#8217;s arguments in favor of digital textbooks are contradictory. On the one hand, she asserts that the Web age has de-emphasized the need to retain information and paper textbooks frame education as an &amp;#8220;act of consumption, rather than exploration&amp;#8221;. But putting video, audio and &amp;#8220;interactive content&amp;#8221; (a catch-all term for stuff that lights up, jumps around and tries to make algebra seem less like work), into a medium that by its very definition has boundaries, doesn&amp;#8217;t change any of those facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some textbooks are &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networks-5th-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0132126958'&gt;timeless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0136006639/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1'&gt;classics&lt;/a&gt;. But if most learning outside school is by reading things on the open Web, shouldn&amp;#8217;t learning in schools occur through the same medium? The concept of a textbook is outdated, in my opinion. A textbook is its author&amp;#8217;s opinion of the best way to teach someone something. Putting it on an iPad doesn&amp;#8217;t change this, nor does it turn learning into &amp;#8220;exploration&amp;#8221;. Great teachers do that. Students who ask insightful questions, and are serious about learning, do that. Engaged parents do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A totally open Web isn&amp;#8217;t the answer (blocking pr0n, for instance, is important), but what about an educational search engine that is carefully curated to let students find relevant information? All we have here (mixed metaphors ahoy!) is the world&amp;#8217;s largest technology company peddling their walled-garden Kool-aid to administrators in an effort to hook kids to their stuff early on.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I created my Jekyll based blog for the first time. All the cool kids are doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure if this is really much better than Wordpress (although no MySQL + Git sounds pretty sweet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='julian_assange_on_rolling_stone_magazine'&gt;Julian Assange on Rolling Stone magazine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title='Assange on Rolling Stone' href='http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/julian-assange-the-rolling-stone-interview-20120118'&gt;Julian Assange&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Wikileaks, international hacker and possesor of the coolest white hair around, spoke to Rolling Stones magazine. Some of what he says is sensible: &amp;#8220;people determined to be in a democracy, to be their own governments, must have the power that knowledge will bring&amp;#8221;. Some of it is exactly the kind of thing that a rumoured egomaniac would say: &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t think I have a massive ego&amp;#8221;. Great interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='instagram_on_wp7_before_android'&gt;Instagram on WP7 before Android?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eminently speculative stuff from FastCompany about &lt;a href='http://www.fastcompany.com/1809035/could-instagram-come-to-windows-phone-before-android'&gt;Instagram Coming to Windows Phone before Android&lt;/a&gt; The reasons: WP7 looks better and Microsoft has the cash to incentivize Instagram sufficiently. I&amp;#8217;m going to file this under a &amp;#8220;maybe&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='better_than_the_real_sport_video_of_the_day'&gt;&amp;#8220;Better than the real sport&amp;#8221; video of the day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zorbing is fun. Football is fun. Obviously you have to put them together. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
