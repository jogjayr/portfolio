<p>AT&amp;T head honcho Randall Stephenson put his foot in his mouth on Wednesday, May 2, while demonstrating his commitment to shareholders.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/gcprogram.taf?function=detail&amp;EvID=3314&amp;eventid=GC12'>At a conference</a> hosted by the <a href='http://www.milkeninstitute.org'>Milken institute</a> the New York Times <a href='http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/att-randall-stephenson/'>reported</a> Stephenson bemoaning the decision to give iPhone users all-you-can-eat data.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>My only regret was how we introduced pricing in the beginning, because how did we introduce pricing? Thirty dollars and you get all you can eat. And it’s a variable cost model. Every additional megabyte you use in this network, I have to invest capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Not much sympathy for him there. The iPhone was exclusive to AT&amp;T for 4 years. People who hated AT&amp;T would become subscribers because of the iPhone. And when its massive data sucking caused dropped calls for everyone, people not only put up with it, they <em>bought their own mini cell towers and operated them at their own cost</em>.</p>

<p>Not content with pissing off the masses with his griping about having to spend so fuckin&#8217; much to provide service to his customers, Stephenson railed about the unfairness of it all, with iMessage eating into his sweet, sweet texting margins. Woe is me, indeed.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>You lie awake at night worrying about what is that which will disrupt your business model. Apple iMessage is a classic example. If you’re using iMessage, you’re not using one of our messaging services, right? That’s disruptive to our messaging revenue stream</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>That clearly didn&#8217;t go down well with commenters on the article either. Because text messages are so ridiculously lucrative for carriers, and carry such high margins, it&#8217;s not even funny.</p>

<p>Randall Stephenson was speaking at an industry conference surrounded by fellow worshippers of capitalism (the Milken institute &#8220;believes in the power of capital markets to solve urgent social and economic challenges and improve lives&#8221;). His remarks were clearly right for the setting, and right by his shareholders, but he might&#8217;ve stopped to consider the impression formed with a broader audience, who clearly see this as greedy bellyaching. (Just see the comments on the article)</p>
