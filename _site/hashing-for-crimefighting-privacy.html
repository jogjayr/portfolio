<p>There’s a simple solution to the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/06/03/188397999/supreme-court-rules-arrest-dna-collection-reasonable">Supreme Court’s ruling that taking DNA swabs of arrestees is permissible</a>. It’s a ruling that has privacy advocates <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130603/16534123300/horrifying-supreme-court-ruling-lets-police-collect-dna-because-you-might-just-be-horrible-criminal.shtml">up</a> <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130603/16534123300/horrifying-supreme-court-ruling-lets-police-collect-dna-because-you-might-just-be-horrible-criminal.shtml">in</a> <a href="http://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/aclu-comment-maryland-v-king-decision">arms</a>.</p>

<p>There are reasons to worry about this decision. Some are speculative, pessimistic or dystopian: it opens the door to a police state, it makes it easier for authorities to track your whereabouts and frame you. Some are genuine: DNA is private information about the very thing that makes a person who they are, and there are fears that insurance companies and even less benign parties may gain access to this information to misuse it.</p>

<p>Since I’m in Silicon Valley, it’s almost obligatory to come up with a technological solution to this. The basic <a href="http://www.cigna.com/individualandfamilies/health-and-well-being/hw/dna-fingerprinting-in-a-criminal-investigation-zm2567.html#zm2567-sec">DNA fingerprinting process</a> is a 4-step procedure that ends with a nylon membrane with a pattern on it, which can be compared to existing patterns. I propose creating a national DNA fingerprint database, similar to the one the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/iafis/iafis">FBI has for regular fingerprints</a>. The database should, by law, only be allowed to store a hash of a person’s DNA pattern.</p>

<p>To revise (and for non-tech readers), a hash is what you get when you run a piece of information through a hashing algorithm. A hash of a given data set has 2 properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>It’s unique</li>

<li>You can’t get the original data back just from the hash value</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, the hash of the string “I love tacos” using the MD5 algorithm is:</p>

<pre><code>b5d19ec884a387e767811afbe097affc</code></pre>

<p>And if you are given just “b5d19ec884a387e767811afbe097affc” you could never tell that it was generated by hashing “I love tacos”. You could also say with a high degree of certainty that only the string “I love tacos” would give you “b5d19ec884a387e767811afbe097affc”.</p>

<p>Do the same thing with DNA information (with a different, better algorithm, obviously) and the benefits are obvious:</p>

<ol>
<li>Law enforcement has another tool to identify suspects uniquely. When they arrest a suspect, they swab him or her, a device calculates and stores the hash of the DNA on the swab and the swab is destroyed immediately. They compare the hash to hashes already in the database.</li>

<li>Privacy advocates are happy because it reduces DNA information to something as devoid of external meaning as a fingerprint. A DNA hash can’t betray anything about a person’s ancestry, probabilities of developing medical conditions or anything else that can be gleaned from a DNA sample.</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone wins here. Hashed databases have to be the way to go.</p>
