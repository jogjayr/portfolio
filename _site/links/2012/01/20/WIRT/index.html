<p>At Ars Technica, <a href='http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/why-the-feds-smashed-megaupload.ars' title='Why the feds smashed Megaupload'>Nate Anderson</a>, does a great piece on analyzing the specific timing of the Megaupload crackdown, with his sources implying that it wasn&#8217;t a coincidence that it happened a day after Congress&#8217; SOPA/PIPA debacle. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Schmitz' title='Kim Dotcom'>Kim Dotcom</a> is a great name, it has to be said.</p>

<p>Over at CNET <a href='http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-57362437-256/anonymous-goes-nuclear-everybody-loses/' title='Anonymous Megaupload'>Molly Wood</a> criticized Anonymous&#8217; actions in DDoS-ing the Justice Department, MPAA, RIAA, Boy Scouts of America and half a dozen nuns at a mission in Costa Rica. IMHO, no one except Justice Department, MPAA and RIAA employees, and reporters doing research, ever accesses those websites. Despite a scary looking screenshot from <a href='http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/dataviz1.html,' title='Akamai Internet Monitor'>Akamai&#8217;s Internet monitor</a>, it&#8217;s evident that the US has actually had fewer attacks in the last 24 hours (not sure how Akamai defines an &#8220;attack&#8221;) than parts of the world that have had nothing to do with these events, to wit Brazil, Peru, China, Russia and Taiwan.</p>

<h3 id='googleappleadobe_poaching_antitrust_lawsuit'>Google-Apple-Adobe Poaching Antitrust Lawsuit</h3>

<p><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/19/damning-evidence-emerges-in-google-apple-no-poach-antitrust-lawsuit/' title='Google Apple Poaching'>Techcrunch</a> reported that the Department of Justice found documentary evidence of &#8220;no-poaching&#8221; agreements between some of the Valley&#8217;s highest-profile companies, among them Google, Apple, Adobe, Intuit, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Intel.</p>

<p>The companies agreed not only to not steal each others&#8217; employees but even notify an applicant&#8217;s current employers, a move one would associate with the likes of Foxconn or Soviet Russia. Presumably, the offending employees are then sent off to gulags/iPhone-assembly factories with n-hexane.</p>

<p>From lobbying to loosen immigration laws for skilled workers to <a href='http://www.codecademy.com/'>funding companies</a> and <a href='http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-57358837-52/nyc-high-school-will-train-badly-needed-software-engineers/'>even high schools</a> dedicated to teaching people how to program computers, tech companies are pulling out all the stops to keep programmer costs down. I don&#8217;t know much about AI but given the incentives and economics of the thing, you have to figure that somewhere along the line, someone will surely teach computers how to program themselves to a sufficiently high skill level. Hopefully, that won&#8217;t happen in my lifetime, but the odds aren&#8217;t good.</p>

<h3 id='apples_foray_into_textbooks'>Apple&#8217;s Foray into Textbooks</h3>

<p><a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/a-brief-history-of-textbooks-or-why-apples-new-textbook-experience-is-actually-revolutionary/251662/'>Megan Garber</a> in The Atlantic reckons that Apple&#8217;s new approach to textbooks is revolutionary. The reason: textbooks become personal because students can write in them and keep them even after they&#8217;re done with the course. While I agree that there&#8217;s some value in getting to keep a textbook forever, the fact remains that once the student leaves school, she must buy an iDevice or read it on a computer screen from iTunes. There&#8217;s no escaping Apple&#8217;s walled garden. And in a world with Wikipedia, why would anyone restrict themselves to their history textbook as their sole source of information on the Mexican-American war?</p>

<p>In addition, the author&#8217;s arguments in favor of digital textbooks are contradictory. On the one hand, she asserts that the Web age has de-emphasized the need to retain information and paper textbooks frame education as an &#8220;act of consumption, rather than exploration&#8221;. But putting video, audio and &#8220;interactive content&#8221; (a catch-all term for stuff that lights up, jumps around and tries to make algebra seem less like work), into a medium that by its very definition has boundaries, doesn&#8217;t change any of those facts.</p>

<p>Some textbooks are <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networks-5th-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0132126958'>timeless</a> <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0136006639/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1'>classics</a>. But if most learning outside school is by reading things on the open Web, shouldn&#8217;t learning in schools occur through the same medium? The concept of a textbook is outdated, in my opinion. A textbook is its author&#8217;s opinion of the best way to teach someone something. Putting it on an iPad doesn&#8217;t change this, nor does it turn learning into &#8220;exploration&#8221;. Great teachers do that. Students who ask insightful questions, and are serious about learning, do that. Engaged parents do that.</p>

<p>A totally open Web isn&#8217;t the answer (blocking pr0n, for instance, is important), but what about an educational search engine that is carefully curated to let students find relevant information? All we have here (mixed metaphors ahoy!) is the world&#8217;s largest technology company peddling their walled-garden Kool-aid to administrators in an effort to hook kids to their stuff early on.</p>
