    <h3 id='new_employee_discount_program_at_apple'>New Employee Discount Program at Apple</h3>

<p>Splendid stretching of the definition of &#8220;news&#8221; by <a href='http://9to5mac.com/2012/01/25/tim-cook-at-todays-town-hall-starting-in-june-apple-employees-get-500-off-macs-250-off-ipads/'>9to5Mac</a>. Apple (Designed in California&#8482;) CEO Tim Cook announced a new employee benefit at the company&#8217;s internal town hall yesterday. Starting June, all employees will get $500 off (in addition to their existing 25% discount on all company products) on Macs and iPads. The catch: they can only use it once every 3 years. This works out to about $167/year/employee.</p>

<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of employee benefits, the gold standard must surely be Google, who announced a <a href='http://articles.businessinsider.com/2010-11-09/tech/30024423_1_google-ceo-googlers-eric-schmidt'>$1000 (post-tax) Christmas bonus and an across-the-board 10% salary hike</a> 2 years ago. Compared to that, the most valuable company in the world giving out $167 in store credit is a bit laughable.</p>

<h3 id='att_try_to_be_more_tonedeaf_than_mpaa'>AT&amp;T Try to be More Tone-Deaf than MPAA</h3>

<p>AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stevenson is doing his best to cement his company&#8217;s position at the <a href='http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2011/12/survey-at38t-rates-last-in-customer-satisfaction/1'>bottom of the customer satisfaction rankings</a>.</p>

<p>Still peeved at the breakdown of the T-Mobile acquisition thanks to the FCC, Stevenson announced that AT&amp;T would have to increase data prices because of a lack of capacity, because they weren&#8217;t allowed to acquire T-Mobile.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a capacity-constrained environment we will manage usage-based data plans, increased pricing and managing the speeds of the highest volume users. These are all logical and necessary steps to manage utilization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As has already been pointed out though, AT&amp;T has actually reduced their per-unit price for data on all plans. The only effect of the &#8220;price increase&#8221; has been to force customers onto more expensive plans, even though they pay less per unit of data on these plans. Clearly capacity isn&#8217;t a problem at AT&amp;T if they can afford to give out more for less. Instead as <a href='http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/att_ceo_randall_stevenson_blasts_fcc_hints_at_high.php'>ReadWriteWeb</a> points out, this is more of a punishment to their customers and the FCC. Or a tantrum. However you want to look at it.</p>

<p>This blog suggests that AT&amp;T take some of that $40 billion they were planning to spend on buying T-Mobile and put some more cell towers up. Maybe give out some <a href='http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20001242-264.html'>femtocells for free</a>?</p>
