<p>Rio Ferdinand of Manchester United (sigh) was responsible for a storm in a tempest (shield your eyes if you expect cliches used correctly) today when he promoted a Snickers bar on his Twitter feed.</p>

<p>Paul Sawers at <a href='http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/01/28/brands-may-be-paying-celebrities-for-tweets-but-whos-paying-twitter/'>The Next Web</a> wrote that the UK authorities might have a problem with any implied (ie, not explicit) endorsement as being unfair. It&#8217;s safe to say that won&#8217;t happen (as many commenters on the post pointed out), because of the #spon hashtag, coupled with the fact that it was so out of the ordinary for Rio (sample tweet: &#8220;Morning tweeps! Back from training! Wazza in my #pocket. #stayonyourfeet #piershasmoobs&#8221;)</p>

<p>Unless Rio was doing this for charity, it&#8217;s also worth wondering how much Snickers paid him to piss off his 2 million followers. And pissed off they were. It must be a lot, because he&#8217;s one of the highest paid players in the Premier League.</p>

<h3 id='fight_fight_fight'>Fight! Fight! Fight!</h3>

<p>YC-backed Curebit were caught red-handed being very naughty. The firm&#8217;s <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/allangrant'>Allan Grant</a> was embroiled in a pitched Twitter battle with RoR creator <a href='https://twitter.com/#!/dhh'>David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (whose middle name is the answer to the question: &#8220;What should I do if I get 4 Es and 2 Is in Scrabble?&#8221;) about copied HTML code, design and even (shamefully) hot-linked images from one of Hansson&#8217;s 37Signals sites (or something like that).</p>

<p>Grant started off defensive (&#8220;we&#8217;re a small company&#8221;), then quickly discovered that the leg he thought he had to stand on (he&#8217;d hot-linked to this leg too) did not exist (it started 404-ing). With the tide of popular Intertweets opinion turning against him, he quickly capitulated (or at least, pretended to). For me, this has ended in disappointing fashion. Hansson is a racecar driver and who wouldn&#8217;t have paid to see the two of them race down the Golden Gate Bridge to settle this? (give me a break, I don&#8217;t know jack about SFO&#8217;s geography).</p>
