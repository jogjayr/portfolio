title: Apple, Google, Adobe set up informant networks
teaser: The Valley's greatest companies are riven with informants looking for defectors, Anonymous can be blamed for anyone's 
        server problems, and Apple (Designed in California&trade;) look to take kids' lunch money and give them shiny iPads.

###Fallout from the Megaupload takedown

At Ars Technica, 
[Nate Anderson](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/why-the-feds-smashed-megaupload.ars "Why the feds smashed Megaupload"), 
does a great piece on analyzing the specific timing of the Megaupload crackdown, with his sources implying that 
it wasn't a coincidence that it happened a day after Congress' SOPA/PIPA debacle.
[Kim Dotcom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Schmitz "Kim Dotcom") is a great name, it has to be said. 

Over at CNET 
[Molly Wood](http://news.cnet.com/8301-31322_3-57362437-256/anonymous-goes-nuclear-everybody-loses/ "Anonymous Megaupload")
criticized Anonymous' actions in DDoS-ing the Justice Department, MPAA, RIAA, Boy Scouts of America and half a dozen nuns
at a mission in Costa Rica. IMHO, no one except Justice Department, MPAA and RIAA employees, and reporters doing 
research, ever accesses those websites. Despite a scary looking screenshot from [Akamai's Internet monitor](http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/dataviz1.html, "Akamai Internet Monitor"), 
it's evident that the US has actually had fewer attacks in the last 24 hours (not sure how Akamai defines an "attack") than parts
of the world that have had nothing to do with these events, to wit Brazil, Peru, China, Russia and Taiwan.


###Google-Apple-Adobe Poaching Antitrust Lawsuit

[Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/19/damning-evidence-emerges-in-google-apple-no-poach-antitrust-lawsuit/ "Google Apple Poaching")
reported that the Department of Justice found documentary evidence of "no-poaching" agreements between some of the Valley's
highest-profile companies, among them Google, Apple, Adobe, Intuit, Lucasfilm, Pixar and Intel. 

The companies agreed not only to not steal each others' employees but even notify an applicant's current employers,
a move one would associate with the likes of Foxconn or Soviet Russia. Presumably, the offending employees are then
sent off to gulags/iPhone-assembly factories with n-hexane. 

From lobbying to loosen immigration laws for skilled workers to [funding companies](http://www.codecademy.com/) and 
[even high schools](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-57358837-52/nyc-high-school-will-train-badly-needed-software-engineers/) 
dedicated to teaching people how to program computers, tech companies are pulling out all the stops to keep programmer 
costs down. I don't know much about AI but given the incentives and economics of the thing,
you have to figure that somewhere along the line, someone will surely teach computers how to program themselves 
to a sufficiently high skill level. Hopefully, that won't happen in my lifetime, but the odds aren't good.

###Apple's Foray into Textbooks

[Megan Garber](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/a-brief-history-of-textbooks-or-why-apples-new-textbook-experience-is-actually-revolutionary/251662/)
in The Atlantic reckons that Apple's new approach to textbooks is revolutionary. The reason: textbooks become personal
because students can write in them and keep them even after they're done with the course. While I agree that there's
some value in getting to keep a textbook forever, the fact remains that once the student leaves school, she must buy
an iDevice or read it on a computer screen from iTunes. There's no escaping Apple's walled garden. And in a world with 
Wikipedia, why would anyone restrict themselves to their history textbook as their sole source of information on
the Mexican-American war?

In addition, the author's arguments in favor of digital textbooks are contradictory. On the one hand, she asserts that
the Web age has de-emphasized the need to retain information and paper textbooks frame education as an 
"act of consumption, rather than exploration". But putting video, audio and "interactive content" (a catch-all term 
for stuff that lights up, jumps around and tries to make algebra seem less like work), into a medium that by its 
very definition has boundaries, doesn't change any of those facts.

Some textbooks are [timeless](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networks-5th-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0132126958) 
[classics](http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0136006639/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1). But if
most learning outside school is by reading things on the open Web, shouldn't learning in schools occur through the same 
medium? The concept of a textbook is outdated, in my opinion. A textbook is its author's opinion of the best way to teach 
someone something. Putting it on an iPad doesn't change this, nor does it turn learning into "exploration". 
Great teachers do that. Students who ask insightful questions, and are serious about learning, do that.
Engaged parents do that. 

A totally open Web isn't the answer (blocking pr0n, for instance, is important), but what about an educational
search engine that is carefully curated to let students find relevant information? All we have here (mixed metaphors ahoy!) 
is the world's largest technology company peddling their walled-garden Kool-aid to administrators in an effort 
to hook kids to their stuff early on.
